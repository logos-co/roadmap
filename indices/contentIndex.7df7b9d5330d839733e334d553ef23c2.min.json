You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-16T15:52:26.098715355Z","tags":["setup"]},"/private/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**! If you are using a `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io` domain, you can skip this step.\n\nFor this last bit to take effect, you also need to create a CNAME record with the DNS provider you register your domain with (i.e. NameCheap, Google Domains).\n\nGitHub has some [documentation on this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but the tldr; is to\n\n1.

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](hosting.md) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide.

But I guess it will be hard to avoid it.  Though it also depends on how fast the network layer (potentially Waku) propagats msgs and also on execution time of the transaction as well.\n\n\u003e `Alvaro:` Well IIUC the only latency we are introducing is directly proportional to the levels of subcommitee nesting (ie the log(n/C)), which is understandably the price to pay. We have to make sure though that what we gain by introducing this is really worth the extra cost vs the typical comittee formation via randao or perhaps VDFs\n\n\u003e `Moh:` Again the Typical committee formation with randao can reduce their wait time value to match our latency, but then it becomes vulnerable and fail if the network latency becomes greater than their slot interval. If they keep it too large it may not fail but becomes slow. We won't have that problem. If an adversary has the power to slow down the network then their liveness will fail, whereas we won't have that issue.\n\n## How would you compare Aptos and Carnot? - Alvaro\n\n\u003e `Moh:` It is variant of DiemBFT, Sui is based on Nahrwal, both cannot scale to more than few hunderd of nodes. That is why they achieve that low latency.\n\n\u003e `Alvaro:` Yes, so they need to select a committee of that size in order to operate at that latency What's wrong with selecting a committee vs Carnot's solution? This I'm asking genuinely to understand and because everyone will ask this question when we release.\n\n\u003e `Moh:` When you select a committee you have to wait for a time slot to make sure the result of consensus has propagated. Again strong synchrony assumption (slot time), formation of forks, increase in PoS attack vector come into play\nWithin committee the protocol does not need a wait time but for its results to get propagated if scalability is to be achieved, then wait time has to be added or signatures have to be collected from thousands of nodes.\n\n\u003e `Alvaro:` Can you elaborate?\n\n\u003e `Moh:` Ethereum (and any other protocol who runs the consensus in a single committee selected from a large group on nodes) has wait time so that the output of the consenus propagates to all honest nodes before the next committee is selected.  Else the next committee will fail or only forks will be formed and chain length won't increase. But since this wait time as stated, increases latency, makes the protocol vulnerable,   Ethereum  wants to avoid it to achieve responsivess.  To avoid wait time (add responsiveness) a protocol has to collect  attestation signatures from 2/3rd of all nodes (not a single committee) to move to the second round (Carnot is already responsive). But aggregating and verifying signatures thousands of signatures is expensive and time consuming. This is why they are working to improve BLS signatures. Instead we have changed the consensus protocol in such a way that a small number of signatures need to be aggregated and verified to achieve responsiveness and fast finality. We can further improve performance by using the improved BLS signatures.\n\n\u003e One cannot achieve fast finality while running the consensus in a small committee. Because attestation of a Block within the single committee is not enough. This block can be averted if the leader of the next committee has not seen it. Therefore, there should be enough delay so that all honest nodes can see it. This is why we have this wait/slot time. Another issue can be a malicious leader from the next chosen committee can also avert a block of honest leader and hence preventing honest leaders from getting rewards. If blocks of honest leaders are averted for long time, stake of malicious leaders will increase. Moreover, malicious leaders can delay blocks of honest nodes by making fork and averting them. Addressing these issues will further make the protocol complex, while still laking fast finality.\n\n## Data Distribution\n\n### How much failure rate of erasure code transmission are we expecting. Basically, what are the EC coding parameters that we expect to be sending such that we have some failure rate of transmission? Has that been looked into? - Dmitriy\n\u003e `Moh:` This is a great question and it points to the tension between the failure rate vs overhead. We have briefly looked into this (today me and Marcin @madxor discussed such cases), but we haven’t thoroughly analyzed this. In our case, the rate of failure also depends on committee size. We look into $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-6}$ probability of failure. And in this case, the coding overhead can be somewhere between 200%-500% approximately. This means for a committee size of 500 (while expecting receipt of messages from 251 correct nodes), for a failure rate of $10^{-6}$ a single node has to send \u003e 6Mb of data for a 1Mb of actual data. Though 5x overhead is large, it still prevent us from sending/receiving 500 Mb of data in return for a failure probability of 1 proposal out of 1 million. From the protocol perspective, we can address EC failures in multiple ways: a: Since the root committee only forwards the coded chunks only when they have successfully rebuilt the block. This means the root committee can be contacted to download additional coded chunks to decode the block. b: We allow this failure and let the leader be replaced but since there is proof that the failure is due to the reason that a decoder failed to reconstruct the block, therefore, the leader cannot be punished (if we chose to employ punishment in PoS). \n\n### How much data should a given block be. Are there limits on this and if so, what are they and what do they depend on? - Dmitriy\n\u003e `Moh:` This question can be answered during simulations and experiments over links of different bandwidths and latencies. We will test the protocol performances with different block sizes. As we know increasing the block size results in increased throughput as well as latency. What is the most appropriate block size can be determined once we observe the tradeoff between throughput vs latency.\n\n## Signature Propagation\n\n### Who sends the signatures up from a given committee? Do that have any leadered power within the committee? - Tanguy\n\u003e `Moh:` Each node in a committee multicasts its vote to all members of the parent committee. Since the size of the vote is small the bit complexity will be low. Introducing a leader within each committee will create a single point of failure within each committee. This is why we avoid maintaining a leader within each committee\n\n## Network Scale\n\n### What is our expected minimum number of nodes within the network? - Dmitriy\n\u003e `Moh:` For a small number of nodes we can have just a single committee. But I am not sure how many nodes will join our network \n\n## Byzantine Behavior\n\n### Can we also consider a flavor that adds attestation/attribution to misbehaving nodes? That will come at a price but there might be a set of use cases which would like to have lower performance with strong attribution. Not saying that it must be part of the initial design, but can be think-through/added later. - Marcin\n\u003e `Moh:` Attestation to misbehaving nodes is part of this protocol. For example, if a node sends an incorrect vote or if a leader proposes an invalid transaction, then this proof will be shared with the network to punish the misbehaving nodes (Though currently this is not part of pseudocode). But it is not possible to reliably prove the attestation of not participation.\n\n\u003e `Marcin:` Great, and definitely, we cannot attest that a node was not participating - I was not suggesting that;). But we can also think about extending the attestation for lazy-participants case (if it’s not already part of the protocol).\n\n\u003e `Moh:` OK, thanks for the clarification 😁 . Of course we can have this feature to forward the proof of participation of successor committees. In the first version of Carnot we had this feature as a sliding window. One could choose the size of the window (in terms of tree levels) for which a node should forward the proof of participation. In the most recent version the size of sliding window is 0. And it is 1 for the root committee. It means root committee members have to forward the proof of participation of their child committee members. Since I was able to prove protocol correctness without forwarding the proofs so we avoid it. But it can be part of the protocol without any significant changes in the protocol\n\n\u003e If the proof scheme is efficient ( as the results you presented) in practice and the cost of creating and verifying proofs is not significant then actually adding proofs can be good. But not required.\n\n### Also, how do you reward online validators / punish offline ones if you can't prove at the block level that someone attested or not? - Tanguy\n\u003e `Moh:` This is very tricky and so far no one has done it right (to my knowledge). Current reward mechanism for attestation, favours fast nodes.This means if malicious nodes in the network are fast, they can increase their stake in the network faster than the honest nodes and eventually take control of the network. Or in the case of Ethereum a Byzantine leader can include signature of malicious nodes more frequently in the proof of attestation, hence malicious nodes will be rewarded more frequently. Also let me add that I don't have definite answer to your question currently, but I think by revising the protocol assumptions, incentive mechanism and using a game theoretical approach this problem can be resolved.\n\n\u003e An honest node should wait for a specific number of children votes (to make sure everyone is voting on the same proposal) before voting but does not need to provide any cryptographic proof. Though we build a threshold signature from root committee members and it’s children but not from the whole tree. As long as enough number of nodes follow the the protocol we should be fine. I am working on protocol proofs. Also I think bugs should be discovered during development and testing phase. Changing protocol to detect potential bug might not be a good practice.\n\n### doesn't having randomly distributed malicious nodes (say there is a 20%) increase the odds that over a third of a committee end up being from those malicious ones? It seems intuitive: since a 20% at the global scale is always \u003c1/3, but when randomly distributed there is always non-zero chance they end up in a single group, thus affecting liveness more and more the closer we get to that global 1/3. Consequently, if I'm understanding the algorithm correctly, it would have worse liveness guarantees that classical pBFT, say with a randomly-selected commitee from the total set.  - Alvaro\n\n\u003e `Alexander:` We assume that fraction of malicious nodes is $1/4$ and given we chooses comm. sizes, which will depend on total number of nodes, appropriately this guarantees that with high probability we are below $1/3$ in each committee.\n\n\u003e `Alvaro:` ok, but then both the global guarantee is below that current \"standard\" of 1/3 of malicious nodes and even then we are talking about non-zero probabilities that a comm has the power to slow down consensus via requiring reformation of comms (is this right?)\n\n\u003e `Alexander:` This is the price  we pay to improve  scalability. Also these probabilities of failure can be very low.\n\n### What happens in Carnot when one committee is taken over by \u003e1/3 intra-comm byzantine nodes? - Alvaro\n\n\u003e `Moh:` When there is a failure the overlay is recalculated. By gradually increasing the fault tolerance by a small value, the probability of failure of a committee slightly increases but upon recalculating the correct overlay, inactive nodes that caused the failure of previous overlay (when no committee has more than 1/3 Byzantine nodes) will be slashed.\n\n\n\n## Synchronicity\n\n### How to guarantee synchronicity. In particular how to avoid that in a big network different nodes see a proposal with 2c+1 votes but different votes and thus different random seed - Giacomo\n\n\u003e `Moh:` The assumption is that there exists some known finite time bound Δ and a special event called GST (Global Stabilization Time) such that:\n\n\u003e The adversary must cause the GST event to eventually happen after some unknown finite time. Any message sent at time x must be delivered by time $\\delta + \\text{max}(x,GST)$. In the Partial synchrony model, the system behaves asynchronously till GST and synchronously after GST.\n\n\u003e Moreover, votes travel  one  level at a time from tree leaves to the tree root. We only need the proof of votes of root+child committees to conclude with a high probability that the majority of nodes have voted.\n\n### That's a timeout? How does this work exactly without timing assumptions? Trying to find this in the document -Alvaro\n\n\u003e `Moh:` Each committee only verifies the votes of its child committees. Once a verified 2/3rd votes of its child members, it then sends it vote to its parent. In this way each layer of the tree verifies the votes (attests) the layer below. Thus, a node does not have to collect and verify 2/3rd of all thousands of votes (as done in other responsive BFTs) but only from its child nodes.","lastmodified":"2023-07-16T15:52:26.106715491Z","tags":["Carnot","consensus"]},"/private/roadmap/consensus/candidates/carnot/overview":{"title":"Carnot Overview","content":"\nCarnot (formerly LogosBFT) is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) [consensus](roadmap/consensus/index.md) candidate for the Nomos Network that utilizes Fountain Codes and a committees tree structure to optimize message propagation in the presence of a large number of nodes, while maintaining high througput and fast finality. More specifically, these are the research contributions in Carnot. To our knowledge, Carnot is the first consensus protocol that can achieve together all of these properties:\n\n1. Scalability: Carnot is highly scalable, scaling to thousands of nodes.\n2. Responsiveness: The ability of a protocol to operate with the speed of a wire but not a maximum delay (block delay, slot time, etc.) is called responsiveness. Responsiveness reduces latency and helps the Carnot achieve Fast Finality. Moreover, it improves Carnot's resilience against adversaries that can slow down network traffic. \n3. Fork avoidance: Carnot avoids the formation of forks in a happy path. Forks formation has the following adverse consequences that the Carnot avoids.\n  1. Wastage of resources on orphan blocks and reduced throughput with increased latency for transactions in orphan blocks\n  2.

It gets its name from the thermodynamic concept of the [Carnot Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_cycle), which defines maximal efficiency of work from heat through iterative gas expansions and contractions. \n- [Claro](claro.md) - Claro is a variant of the Avalanche Snow family of protocols, designed to be more efficient at the decision making process by leveraging the concept of \"confidence\" across peer responses. \n\n\n### Theoretical Analysis\n- [snow-family](snow-family.md)\n\n### Development\n- [prototypes](prototypes.md)\n\n## Open Roles\n- [distributed-systems-researcher](distributed-systems-researcher.md)","lastmodified":"2023-07-16T15:52:26.106715491Z","tags":["consensus"]},"/private/roadmap/consensus/theory/overview":{"title":"Consensus Theory Work","content":"\nThis track of work is dedicated to creating theoretical models of distributed consensus in order to evaluate them from a mathematical standpoint. \n\n## Navigation\n- [Snow Family Analysis](snow-family.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-16T15:52:26.106715491Z","tags":["consensus","theory"]},"/private/roadmap/consensus/theory/snow-family":{"title":"Theoretical Analysis of the Snow Family of Consensus Protocols","content":"\nIn order to evaluate the properties of the Avalanche family of consensus protocols more rigorously than the original [whitepapers](), we work to create an analytical framework to explore and better understand the theoretical boundaries of the underlying protocols, and under what parameterization they will break vs a set of adversarial strategies","lastmodified":"2023-07-16T15:52:26.106715491Z","tags":["consensus","theory","snow"]},"/private/roadmap/networking/carnot-waku-specification":{"title":"A Specification proposal for using Waku for Carnot Consensus","content":"\n##### Definition Reference \n- $k$ - size of a given committee\n- $n_C$ - number of committees in the overlay, or nodes in the tree\n- $d$ - depth of the overlay tree\n- $n_d$ - number of committees at a given depth of the tree\n\n## Motivation\nIn #Carnot, an overlay is created to facilitate message distribution and voting aggregation. This document will focus on the differentiated channels of communication for message distribution. Whether or not voting aggregation and subsequenty traversal back up the tree can utilize the same channels will be investigated later. \n\nThe overlay is described as a binary tree of committees, where a individual in each committee propogates messages to an assigned node in their two children committees of the tree, until the leaf nodes have recieved enough information to reconstitute the proposal block. \n\nThis communication protocol will naturally form \"pools of information streams\" that people will need to listen to in order to do their assigned work:\n- inner committee communication\n- parent-child chain communication\n- intitial leader distribution\n\n### **inner committee communication** \nall members of a given committee will need to gossip with each other in order to reform the initial proposal block\n- This results in $n_C$ pools of $k$-sized communication pools.\n\n### **parent-child chain communication** \nThe formation of the committee and the lifecycle of a chunk of erasure coded data forms a number of \"parent-child\" chains. \n- If we completely minimize the communcation between committees, then this results in $k$ number of $n_C$-sized communication pools.\n- It is not clear if individual levels of the tree needs to \"execute\" the message to their children, or if the root committee can broadcast to everyone within its assigned parent-chain communcation pool at the same time.\n- It is also unclear if individual levels of the tree need to send independant messages to each of their children, or if a unified communication pool can be leveraged at the tree-level. This results in $d$ communication pools of $n_d$-size. \n\n### **initial leader distribution**\nFor each proposal, a leader needs to distribute the erasure coded proposal block to the root committee\n- This results in a single communication pool of size $k(+1)$.\n- the $(+1)$ above is the leader, who could also be a part of the root committee. The leader changes with each block proposal, and we seek to minimize the time between leader selection and a round start. Thusly, this results in a requirement that each node in the network must maintain a connection to every node in the root committee. \n\n## Proposal\nThis part of the document will attempt to propose using various aspects of Waku, to facilitate both the setup of the above-mentioned communication pools as well as encryption schemes to add a layer of privacy (and hopefully efficiency) to message distribution. \n\nWe seek to minimize the availability of data such that an individual has only the information to do his job and nothing more.\n\nWe also seek to minimize the amount of messages being passed such that eventually everyone can reconstruct the initial proposal block\n\n`???` for Waku-Relay, 6 connections is optimal, resulting in latency ???\n\n`???` Is it better to have multiple pubsub topics with a simple encryption scheme or a single one with a complex encryption scheme\n\nAs there seems to be a lot of dynamic change from one proposal to the next, I would expect [`noise`](https://vac.dev/wakuv2-noise) to be a quality candidate to facilitate the creation of secure ephemeral keys in the to-be proposed encryption scheme. \n\nIt is also of interest how [`contentTopics`](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/23/) can be leveraged to optimize the communication pools. \n\n## Whiteboard diagram and notes\n![Whiteboard Diagram](images/Overlay-Communications-Brainstorm.png)","lastmodified":"2023-07-16T15:52:26.106715491Z","tags":["waku","carnot","networking","consensus"]},"/private/roadmap/networking/overview":{"title":"P2P Networking Overview","content":"\nThis page summarizes the work around the P2P networking layer of the Nomos project.\n\n## Waku\n[Waku](https://waku.org) is an privacy-preserving, ephemeral, peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging suite of protocols which is developed under [Vac](https://vac.dev) and maintained/productionized by the [Logos Collective](https://logos.co). \n\nIt is hopeful that Nomos can leverage the work of the Waku project to provide the P2P networking layer and peripheral services associated with passing messages around the network. Below is a list of the associated work to investigate the use of Waku within the Nomos Project. \n\n### Scalability and Fault-Tolerance Studies\nCurrently, the amount of research and analysis of the scalability of Waku is not sufficient to give enough confidence that Waku can serve as the networking layer for the Nomos project. Thusly, it is our effort to push this analysis forward by investigating the various boundaries of scale for Waku. Below is a list of endeavors in this direction which we hope serves the broader community: \n- [Status' use of Waku study w/ Kurtosis](status-waku-kurtosis.md)\n- [Using Waku for Carnot Overlay](carnot-waku-specification.md)\n\n### Rust implementations\nWe have created and maintain a stop-gap solution to using Waku with the Rust programming language, which is wrapping the [go-waku](https://github.com/status-im/go-waku) library in Rust and publishing it as a crate. This library allows us to do tests with our [Tiny Node](roadmap/development/prototypes.md#Tiny-Node) implementation more quickly while also providing other projects in the ecosystem to leverage Waku within their Rust codebases more quickly. \n\nIt is desired that we implement a more robust and efficient Rust library for Waku, but this is a significant amount of work. \n\nLinks:\n- [Rust bindings to go-waku repo](https://github.com/waku-org/waku-rust-bindings)","lastmodified":"2023-07-16T15:52:26.106715491Z","tags":["networking","overview"]},"/private/roadmap/networking/status-network-agents":{"title":"Status Network Agents Breakdown","content":"\nThis page creates a model to describe the impact of the various clients within the Status ecosystem by describing their individual contribution to the messages within the Waku network they leverage. \n\nThis model will serve to create a realistic network topology while also informing the appropriate _dimensions of scale_ that are relevant to explore in the [Status Waku scalability study](status-waku-kurtosis.md)\n\nStatus has three main clients that users interface with (in increasing \"network weight\" ordering):\n- Status Web\n- Status Mobile\n- Status Desktop\n\nEach of these clients has differing (on average) resources available to them, and thusly, provides and consumes different Waku protocols and services within the Status network.

But I'm not sure what exactly you're interested in, in the context of rollups...\n1. zk_id _—_ 07/25/2023 3:28 PM\n    \n    The part of the rollups seems to be the base for choosing proofs that scale linearly with the amount of nodes (which makes it impractical for large numbers of nodes). The protocol is very simple, and would only need to instead provide constant proofs with the Kate commitments (at the cost of large computational resources is my understanding). This was at least the rationale that I get from reading the paper and the conversation with Bunz, one of the founders of the Espresso shared sequencer (which is where I found the first reference to this paper). I guess my main open question is why would you do the sampling if you can do VID in the context of blockchains as well. With the proofs of dispersal on-chain, you wouldn't need to do that for the agreement of the dispersal. You still would need the sampling for the light clients though, of course.\n    \n2. dryajov _—_ 07/25/2023 8:31 PM\n    \n    \u003e I guess my main open question is why would you do the sampling if you can do VID in the context of blockchains as well. With the proofs of dispersal on-chain, you wouldn't need to do that for the agreement of the dispersal.\n    \n    Yeah, great question. What follows is strictly IMO, as I haven't seen this formally contrasted anywhere, so my reasoning can be wrong in subtle ways.\n    \n    - (A)VID - **dispersing** and storing data in a verifiable manner\n    - Sampling - verifying already **dispersed** data\n    \n    tl;dr Sampling allows light nodes to protect against dishonest majority attacks. In other words, a light node cannot be tricked to follow an incorrect chain by a dishonest validator majority that withholds data. More details are here - [https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2019/12/20/data-availability-checks.html](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2019/12/20/data-availability-checks.html \"https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2019/12/20/data-availability-checks.html\") ------------- First, DAS implies (A)VID, as there is an initial phase where data is distributed to some subset of nodes. Moreover, these nodes, usually the validators, attest that they received the data and that it is correct. If a majority of validators accepts, then the block is considered correct, otherwise it is rejected. This is the verifiable dispersal part. But what if the majority of validators are dishonest? Can you prevent them from tricking the rest of the network from following the chain?\n    \n    Dankrad Feist\n    \n    [Data availability checks](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2019/12/20/data-availability-checks.html)\n    \n    Primer on data availability checks\n    \n3. _[_8:31 PM_]_\n    \n    ## Dealing with dishonest majorities\n    \n    This is easy if all the data is downloaded by all nodes all the time, but we're trying to avoid just that. But lets assume, for the sake of the argument, that there are full nodes in the network that download all the data and are able to construct fraud proofs for missing data, can this mitigate the problem? It turns out that it can't, because proving data (un)availability isn't a directly attributable fault - in other words, you can observe/detect it but there is no way you can prove it to the rest of the network reliably. More details here [https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding](https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding \"https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding\") So, if there isn't much that can be done by detecting that a block isn't available, what good is it for? Well nodes can still avoid following the unavailable chain and thus be tricked by a dishonest majority. However, simply attesting that data has been publishing is not enough to prevent a dishonest majority from attacking the network.

Honest full nodes, obviously, will not follow this chain, as they can’t download the data. But light clients will not know that the data is not available since they don’t try to download the data, only the header. So we are in a situation where the honest full nodes know that something fishy is going on, but they have no means of alerting the light clients, as they are missing the piece of data that might be needed to create a fraud proof.\n    \n    Both articles are a bit old, but the intuitions still hold.\n    \n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\n6. zk_id _—_ 07/26/2023 10:42 AM\n    \n    Thanks a ton @dryajov !

At the end we decided to roll our own toy group chat protocol implementation because we did not find anything ready to use.

I did not find a JS API for status (maybe I was looking at the wrong places), the closest was the `status-js-api` project but that still uses whisper and the repo recommends to use `js-waku` instead ![🙂](https://discord.com/assets/da3651e59d6006dfa5fa07ec3102d1f3.svg) [https://github.com/status-im/status-js-api](https://github.com/status-im/status-js-api \"https://github.com/status-im/status-js-api\") Also I also found the `56/STATUS-COMMUNITIES` spec: [https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/56/](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/56/ \"https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/56/\") It seems to be quite a complete solution for community management with all the bells and whistles. However our use case is a private group chat for your existing contacts, so it seems to be a bit overkill for that.\n    \n4. fryorcraken _—_ Today at 5:32 AM\n    \n    The repo is status-im/status-web\n    \n5. _[_5:33 AM_]_\n    \n    Spec is [https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/55/](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/55/ \"https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/55/\")\n    \n6. fryorcraken\n    \n    The repo is status-im/status-web\n    \n7. attila🍀 _—_ Today at 6:05 AM\n    \n    As constructive feedback I can tell you that it is not trivial to find it and use it in other projects It is presented as a React component without documentation and by looking at the code it seems to provide you the whole chat UI of the desktop app, which is not necessarily what you need if you want to embed it in your app It seems to be using this package: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@status-im/js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@status-im/js \"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@status-im/js\") Which also does not have documentation I assume that package is built from this: [https://github.com/status-im/status-web/tree/main/packages/status-js](https://github.com/status-im/status-web/tree/main/packages/status-js \"https://github.com/status-im/status-web/tree/main/packages/status-js\") This looks promising, but again there is no documentation. Of course you can use the code to figure out things, but at least I would be interested in what are the requirements and high level architecture (does it require an ethereum RPC endpoint, where does it store data, etc.) so that I can evaluate if this is the right approach for me. So maybe a lesson here is to put effort in the documentation and the presentation as well and if you have the budget then have someone on the team whose main responsibility is that (like a devrel or dev evangelist role)","lastmodified":"2023-08-03T16:00:41.712472167Z","tags":["ilab-updates"]},"/roadmap/nomos/updates/2023-07-24":{"title":"2023-07-24 Nomos weekly","content":"\n**Research**\n\n- Milestone 1: Understanding Data Availability (DA) Problem\n - High-level exploration and discussion on data availability problems in a collaborative offsite meeting in Paris.\n - Explored the necessity and key challenges associated with DA.\n - In-depth study of Verifiable Information Dispersal (VID) as it relates to data availability.\n - **Blocker:** The experimental tests for our specific EC scheme are pending, which is blocking progress to make final decision on KZG + commitments for our architecture.\n- Milestone 2: Privacy for Proof of Stake (PoS)\n - Analyzed the capabilities and limitations of mixnets, specifically within the context of timing attacks in private PoS.\n - Invested time in understanding timing attacks and how Nym mixnet caters to these challenges.\n - Reviewed the Crypsinous paper to understand its privacy vulnerabilities, notably the issue with probabilistic leader election and the vulnerability of anonymous broadcast channels to timing attacks.\n\n**Development**\n\n- Milestone 1: Mixnet and Networking\n - Initiated integration of libp2p to be used as the full node's backend, planning to complete in the next phase.\n - Begun planning for the next steps for mixnet integration, with a focus on understanding the components of the Nym mixnet, its problem-solving mechanisms, and the potential for integrating some of its components into our codebase.\n- Milestone 2: Simulation Application\n - Completed pseudocode for Carnot Simulator, created a test pseudocode, and provided a detailed description of the simulation.
