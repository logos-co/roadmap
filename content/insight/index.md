### Description
The insight team acts as a glue within the Logos Collective. They serve development projects by helping to track development activity and aiding in resource allocation. They serve the broader service units within the organization by helping them understand who's doing what, how much effort is going into each chunk of work, how much it costs, and future projections of milestone delivery. 

This page tracks the various work that they engage in throughout the org. As this is a service unit and not a project, it does not strictly work off a milestone based approach and has consistent service work to the various groups within the Logos Collective.
