`vac:qa:waku:interop-testing-2024q4`

## Description

The interop testing framework already provides extensive coverage, running hundreds of tests across both nwaku and gowaku. Initially, the focus was on functional testing, targeting protocols in isolation. 
For this milestone, we aim to extend coverage with more complex and edge-case scenarios. Enhancements include identifying negative test cases, running scenarios with multiple nodes, and improving CI execution speed by leveraging more powerful runners. Once the execution speed meets acceptable thresholds, we will integrate this expanded suite or a subset of tests into the nwaku/go-waku CI pipelines, ensuring PR-level validation.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

* The VAC QA team plays a key role in supporting internal collaboration and efficiency across projects by ensuring the quality of Wakuâ€™s interop framework. 
* By finding issues in specs during testing, VAC strengthens the RFC culture, contributing to continuous improvement and community engagement.
* By working with developers to address known issues and enhancing CI performance, VAC directly contributes to IFT's strategic objective of scaling capacity and efficiency through community-driven efforts.

## Task List

### Edge Cases

* fully qualified name: `vac:qa:waku:interop-testing-2024q4:edge-cases`
* owner: fbarbu15
* status: not started
* start-date: 2024/10/07
* end-date: 2024/10/21

#### Description 
Expand the coverage to include negative scenarios, ensuring that all edge cases are handled appropriately. Focus on edge cases that might not be triggered in normal operational flows, such as protocol failures, unexpected data or unexpected node behavior.

#### Deliverables 
* PR link with added edge-case tests  
* CI runs showing successful or failed executions with detailed reports  

### E2E Scenarios

* fully qualified name: `vac:qa:waku:interop-testing-2024q4:e2e-scenarios`
* owner: fbarbu15
* status: not started
* start-date: 2024/10/21
* end-date: 2024/11/04

#### Description 
Design and implement end-to-end test scenarios involving at least 4-5 nodes. These tests will assess interoperability between nodes and validate the system's ability to handle realistic use cases. Incorporate the validation of node metrics at the conclusion of each test to ensure performance stability.

#### Deliverables 
* PR with E2E test suite  
* CI runs with successful multi-node E2E test executions  

### Known Issues

* fully qualified name: `vac:qa:waku:interop-testing-2024q4:known-issues`
* owner: fbarbu15
* status: not started
* start-date: 2024/11/04
* end-date: 2024/11/18

#### Description 
Work closely with developers to identify known issues that require testing. Develop test cases for the most critical and impactful issues and solicit input from developers for additional scenarios to cover. Each developer or user interacts with the product in slightly different ways, which can potentially uncover unexpected behavior. Developers can provide valuable feedback on such cases. They also work closely with node operators and are often aware of the issues reported by them. Another point is to check reported GitHub issues and identify which tests can be automated based on those issues. This ensures that once an issue is closed, it doesn't resurface again.

#### Deliverables 
* PRs with tests covering known issues  
* CI runs validating issue resolution and bug regression tests  

### Faster Runners

* fully qualified name: `vac:qa:waku:interop-testing-2024q4:faster-runners`
* owner: fbarbu15
* status: not started
* start-date: 2024/11/18
* end-date: 2024/12/02

#### Description 
Optimize CI execution speed by leveraging more powerful runners and improving test parallelization. Ensure that these changes maintain or improve the quality of the tests without compromising coverage.

#### Deliverables 
* CI configuration updates with improved runners  
* CI runs demonstrating reduced execution time while passing all tests  

### CI Integration

* fully qualified name: `vac:qa:waku:interop-testing-2024q4:ci-integration`
* owner: fbarbu15
* status: not started
* start-date: 2024/12/02
* end-date: 2024/12/09

#### Description 
Integrate a subset of the interop tests into the existing nwaku/go-waku CI pipelines. The execution time should not exceed 15 minutes, balancing speed with meaningful test coverage. The goal is to catch issues earlier in the PR lifecycle without adding significant overhead to CI.

#### Deliverables 
* PR to nwaku/go-waku repos with CI test integration  
* CI runs verifying that the interop tests complete within the set time limits  

### Network Conditions

* fully qualified name: `vac:qa:waku:interop-testing-2024q4:network-conditions`
* owner: fbarbu15
* status: not started
* start-date: 2024/12/09
* end-date: 2024/12/24

#### Description 
Develop tests to simulate unusual network conditions, such as high latency, packet loss, and low bandwidth, particularly affecting light nodes. The framework should be flexible enough to allow for the application of these conditions across a full test run on-demand. Additionally, ensure that a subset of these tests runs nightly to catch issues that may arise under suboptimal network conditions.

#### Deliverables 
* PR with network condition simulation framework  
* CI configuration for on-demand full test runs with network constraints  
* Nightly CI runs for a subset of tests under network strain
