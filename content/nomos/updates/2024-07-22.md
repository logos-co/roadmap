## `P2P Privacy`

### `Research`

- All new mixnet-related PRs in the `nomos-specs` have been closed. New PRs will be opened once we're ready to write the technical specs.
- Simulations are now being added in the `nomos-simulations` repository.
- [PR #6](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations/pull/6): The initial mixnet simulation is ready to be reviewed. This PR has some missing pieces that will be added in the next PRs (to make the PR smaller and easily check if the simulation works correctly).
- [PR #7](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations/pull/7): Now using gossiping for broadcasting after mix.
- [PR #9](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations/pull/9): Added dissemination time measurement.
- Updated the Noisy lottery [section](https://www.notion.so/NomMix-Peer-to-Peer-Mix-Network-over-Gossip-Channel-11e9c70a656d4ff1858bc46a715f4c59?pvs=4#0e8f253c7bff4c23998c0dec7d434ca8) and worked out the details of the level 1 messaging noise generation mechanism, with a collection of algorithms that gradually build up the complexity.
- As a result of the process of reducing complexity and clarifying the objectives of what we want to analyze and simulate, written a dictated [subsection](https://www.notion.so/NomMix-Peer-to-Peer-Mix-Network-over-Gossip-Channel-11e9c70a656d4ff1858bc46a715f4c59?pvs=4#6e19568e489f4b3cb095dc4c0faed5f9) for simulation and analytics for the queuing mechanism.
- Analysis of the queuing system in the NomMix node: considered a queue of messages where a message is removed with probability q from the queue, i.e. the “coin-flipping”. The number of attempts to remove a message from the queue follows a Geometric distribution with parameter q. The latter was verified by simulation of random sampling. Based on this, it follows that a message is delayed in a node by at least RΔ, where Δ is some constant related to the implementation of the queue, with probability (1-q)^R. The summary can be seen [here](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-Nomos-Mixnet-Anonymous-Communication-AC-System-c97d73a7b8894cf7830e8345f0cc37a4?pvs=4#d5d06ad56c09410a8a413dd455b88dce).

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `Data Availability`

### `Research`

- [PR #100](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/100): Direct DA connection protocol - added session control message type, simplified Dispersal and Sample error messages. This has been merged into the `da-poc` branch, it's now in the nomos-poc repo.
- [PR #5](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/5): DA feasibility test for a large number of UDP connections - investigated how a large number of connections would affect different network topologies.
- [PR #6](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/6) (moved from `nomos-specs`): Finalized and merged the PoC PR. Based on this, the [documentation](https://www.notion.so/Proof-of-Concept-Data-Availability-Dispersal-Sampling-50f204f2ff0a41d09de4926962bbb4ef?d=9e9677e5536a46d49fe95f366b7c3320#308624c50f1a42769b6c142976999483) has been updated accordingly.

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `PPoS/Consensus`

### `Research`

- The first version of the Proof of Validator has been prepared in this [document](https://www.notion.so/Proof-of-Validator-Specification-5cd02f594d4d4a66be5e9f1ebf95d7d8).
- WIP: Finalizing studies 1 and 2 of the wealth concentration work (wasn't able to do it last week because the simulations took way longer than expected). Results and report about wealth concentration are [here](https://www.notion.so/Does-Crypsinous-Leader-Election-Function-lead-to-wealth-concentration-in-PoS-b81f07a791b745438443f51f00ac258f?pvs=4#1df422f6cc204cb8b362f41cda260b8b) but still not in a readable format.

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `Coordination Layer`

### `Research`

- Finalized the Proof of Leadership [specification](https://www.notion.so/Proof-of-Leadership-Specifications-894a869ea4e4484c8a3b6af9bdb89443) with error analysis.
- [PR #3](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/3) added - for Proof of Leadership circuits (in circom).
- [PR #106](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/106): Defined and implemented the input proof. The input proof verifies the statement that the ptx input has a valid nullifier, the balance commitment was computed correctly, and reveals a death commitment that was used to spend the note.
- [PR #4](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/4): Balance commitments had a design bug that had broken input/output unlinkability, now resolved.
- [PR #7](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/7): Transfer PoC. This introduced 2 more types of CL proofs: Output and Bundle proofs. Also built up the proof infra around this to allow constructing a fully proved transfer transaction that could be placed on chain.
- [PR #2](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/2): Defined and implemented the first version of zone funds death constraints.
- Expanded the Preconfirmations and Based Sequencing [document](https://www.notion.so/Preconfirmations-and-Based-Sequencing-Preliminary-Research-f5c8c52d44e843e7af503b0259b1a3ef) with new research.
