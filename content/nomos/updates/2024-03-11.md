---

## `cryptarchia`

### `research`

- We have updated the Cryptarchia specification with the update epoch stabilization schedule - [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/79).
- Analysis of adversarial inference of relative stake: derived an equation that can be used to infer the Lagrange parameter in the maximum likelihood inference of relative stake - the details of the [analysis](https://www.overleaf.com/project/656dfacf4929b4a3d6d2ffe5).

### `development`

- Removed assumptions on Carnot being the consensus algorithm in the mempool: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/605).
- Separate ledger and consensus to prepare for integration: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/606).

## `mixnet (network privacy)`

### `Research`

- Work in Progress (WIP): The [Mixnet Incentivization document](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Incentivization-6db9731a221b49878224afd916e2b3ac) has been initiated. Current open questions will be addressed, covering system design, mathematical analysis, and more.
- Continuing work on the mixnet with staking, incorporating modifications based on feedback. A section has been added concerning the hidden bonus of deanonymization. It’s a straightforward observation that random assignment of adversarial nodes can, in some cases, lead to a higher number of adversarial paths than naively expected. Also, a section about discussing the latency and anonymity relationship has been started. WIP [document](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-with-Staking-c8ec3bfd461f4989b3ebbcf4b4b15324#2e57424c79bd44b19c4c4dd624f544b2).
- Analysis of the fraction of compromised paths in the mix network: using an asymptotic lower bound to estimate the probability that the fraction of compromised paths, α, belongs to the interval [α0​,α1​]. The analysis suggests that in the mixnet of size n=240 with L=3 layers sampled from N=800 nodes, where M=200 nodes are adversarial, α can be almost three times larger than the average (M/N)L which assumes a mixnet of infinite width. The parameters n=240, L=3, and N=800 are currently used in Nym’s mixnet. Here for ¼ of adversarial nodes, the fraction of compromised paths can be as high as 0.05. To compare, the average here is 0.02. Summary is provided [here](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-failures-in-the-mix-network-feeef349720842759c59785af71c7c59?pvs=4).

### `development`

- [All PRs](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/569) for Mixnet v1 implementation have been merged. We've taken some additional time to polish the code according to feedback.
- One remaining PR we are working on is adding a compilation option to enable mixnet. We're going to always enable mixnet in production, but we've discussed that it's also good to remain in the libp2p-only compilation mode for development to unblock other dev topics until everything of mixnet becomes stable. Will be finished this early this week.

## `data availability`

### `research`

- No current updates.

### `development`

- Finished RS core encode/decode: there was an issue with different FFT calls from different libraries that didn't work and took a while to debug. They use floating numbers, and when rounding or using a big set of operations, precision leads to errors - [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/75).
- Implemented DA protocol encoder: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/76).
- Implemented DA protocol verifier: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/78).
- DA API mempool tests using a mock implementation [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/604) - The previous PR defined an abstraction for verifying and filtering what to include in the generic mempool; this PR provides mock implementations for TX and Cert verification/filtering. WIP: DA API indexing for data blobs - adding an index to data blob in DA node when the certificate is observed in the block.

## `coordination layer`

### `research`

- We have begun a couple of study documents in terms of the Coordination Layer: [What does it mean for an asset to be “inside” a Zone](https://www.notion.so/What-does-it-mean-for-an-asset-to-be-inside-a-Zone-a38134e2667e43fb80ccf6df0e3d1def) and [Illustrated guide to “Mutator Sets and their Application to Scalable Privacy](https://www.notion.so/Illustrated-guide-to-Mutator-Sets-and-their-Application-to-Scalable-Privacy-17236ccd86994a03b8a4541ea0341a6d). With these documents, we want to solve questions and challenges before delving into the design. 
- The "Parallel Zero Knowledge Virtual Machine" paper has been reviewed, and a brief summary of GKR details has been shared.

### `development`

- Heavily in research, no development updates.

## `testnet`

### `development`

- Explorer works well now, can share the data directories with the node, and provide data through HTTP: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/603).

## `miscellaneous`

- Nomos has a new [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@Nomos) account - our team will be publishing various notes on it - mostly scientific in nature.
- Blog to be released this week. Stay tuned on our website.
