## `P2P Privacy`

### `Research`

- Rewrote the Queue Mechanism Simulations in Rust to make them much faster even with heavy parameters. This version does not use any bloated simulation framework (previously used in Python) and contains only the core logic we want to test. Result: more than 5x faster than the Python version. This is in the [git branch](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations/tree/mixnet-rs), as a PR hasn't been opened yet. The entire Mixnet Workgroup will review the new code this week.
- Added additional experiments: [Experiment 5](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations/commit/0d9cabc329379ffbfd152bd9110b8f441006836c) and [Session 3](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations/commit/8e06695aa44649621b61ea6ce43b90e62b311e07).
- Added additional queue mechanisms: [NoisyCoinFlippingRandomRelease](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations/commit/240f76881d516a3bb883a7d1740690bdf9926fd5) has been added. [Two other additional mechanisms](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Mix-Peer-to-Peer-Mix-Network-over-Gossip-Channel-11e9c70a656d4ff1858bc46a715f4c59?pvs=4#b37a8fdcfafe49d2880c06c3a09e6882) will be added this week.
- Planning the [set of experiments](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Mix-Experiments-Tracking-ad7e2b8f632c4b60a20a2ff65fd03cc9) that we need to run for the next iteration and decided to improve the way we are scheduling them and keeping track of them.
- Made small tweaks to the parameters set for the [sessions 2-4](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Mix-Queueing-Mechanism-Experimentation-Methodology-d629af5a2d43473c9ec9ba191f6d904d?pvs=4#31ba1a7e305d49dfa646c6836785563d) - decided to use a fixed transmission rate as it does not impact the results of our simulations and reduces the number of experiment cases by 2/3.
- Considered a node sending a message to all N−1N-1N−1 nodes of the random network: a message traveling from a node to its neighbor is delayed by the amount of time spent in the out-queue + the connection link latency. Assuming that the random network is locally tree-like, which includes networks prescribed by distributions of node connectivities, the time to deliver a message to all N−1N-1N−1 nodes is equal to the maximum delay over all paths from the sending node to a receiving node. For a node sending a message to its neighbors, calculated the distribution of the maximum delay. The summary can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-Nomos-Mixnet-Anonymous-Communication-AC-System-c97d73a7b8894cf7830e8345f0cc37a4?pvs=4#1323b5075097461a80ebc03a0da2fa4c). Analysis of a message sent from a node in a random regular graph is currently in progress.

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `Data Availability`

### `Research`

- Refined the [DA Technical Specification](https://www.notion.so/DA-Technical-Specification-c6664294d630470ba20aefb21a218f8c?d=dc11993b05bd484da36a858ac83fdbd8#3529ba28472b40ce8ae14cfc8f7a6132) further; it is in green status now (reached the implementation phase).

### `Development`

- [PR #689](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/689) - finished implementing/fixing the DA network sampling layer. Had to rewrite a significant portion of it as the underlying protocol didn't work as expected.
- [PR #690](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/690) - DA Mock network service for CLI app: implemented dispersal of kzgrs encoded data using DA network service with a mock backend (same service will be used with the libp2p backend that will be worked on this week).

## `PPoS/Consensus`

### `Research`

- Developing the [code](https://github.com/vacp2p/token-economics/tree/cryptarchia-selfish-behavior/Nomos/selfish_behavior) to study the selfish behavior of stakers (within the wealth concentration context).
- Conducted more statistical analysis of the "follow the protocol" [study](https://www.notion.so/Data-Analysis-0f0cae08220342bbade7f0048eb3850e).

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `Coordination Layer`

### `Research`

- Benchmark results for zkVMs have been updated, and additions have been made to the ZkVM [document](https://www.notion.so/Possible-ZKVM-s-for-CL-Design-310996a4924149b986f28ed7d387a363) on Notion.
- While working on OlaVM, discovered they are working on Brakedown PCS to speed up proof generation in the future. An explanation about Brakedown has been added to the proof survey [document](https://www.notion.so/Preliminary-Research-Proof-Systems-Survey-ffc625a2ff82407db7a45fd193136258). It also appears to be compatible with Plonky3. Relevant developments will be monitored.
- Published the [report](https://www.notion.so/Atomic-Transfer-PoC-Report-e183a60586154ba99a67b09ee36d25cd?pvs=4) on the results of the atomic transfer PoC.
- Published a writeup on [Permissionless Notes](https://www.notion.so/Permisionless-Notes-76e140e0f38b4c10ad7ba98686acaab6?pvs=4). This resolves some of the problems we had with how adversaries had control over nullifiers which could lead to nullifier collisions and unspendable notes. (An adversary could engineer a note that had the same nullifier as a zone note and could make the zone note unspendable).
- [PR #27](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/27) (POC) - implemented collision-resistant nullifier idea from the permissionless note writeup.
- [PR #28](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/28) (POC) - implemented nonce evolution ideas from the permissionless note writeup.
- [PR #29](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/29) (POC) - implemented in-zone signature verification (adds 60s to atomic transfer scenario time). This gets out the PoC to a realistic enough scenario that we can start optimizing.
- Published several documents as solutions for Immediate Zone Data Availability and for the issues derived from our long finality times: [Timely Data Retrieval for Permissionless Executors](https://www.notion.so/Timely-Data-Retrieval-for-Permissionless-Executors-1c0460ae785c4912842c99f88dab28f5) and [Zones, Finality, and Preconfirmations](https://www.notion.so/What-Remains-to-Achieving-Great-UX-Zones-Finality-and-Preconfirmations-5c2e2684f9404a519c9b6a3c7a62bbef#5d077fa65eef41afa928a8f1f6fc4d1c). These topics might require more work, especially as we discuss them and see what impact they bring to the current design.
