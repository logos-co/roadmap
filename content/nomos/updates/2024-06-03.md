### `Research`

- Continued with the [analysis](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-mix-gadget-6246ab47a8e34ac0bc7b561d32680e34?pvs=4#94785a745fe04b12a6b2a5f15ef5f04b) of random structures generated by the mix gadget and outlined two possible [approaches](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-mix-gadget-6246ab47a8e34ac0bc7b561d32680e34?pvs=4#f6a1e2456cbb483bb41d5706c772f9a2) to the analysis of mix gadget.
- Explained how the timing attack by a passive adversary can be simulated: [Tracing back message flows](https://www.notion.so/WIP-P2P-Privacy-Passive-Adversary-ecbcb7ea509b4337b66de515d900dd50?pvs=4#f34d8c61c46847389d6c0d3115b0f435). In short, we can simulate an adversary who traces back message flows to identify original message senders (i.e. block proposers) and repeats this multiple times to find senders selected more often. This is not the perfect way, but our opinion is that we can enhance this to simulate more powerful adversaries.

### `Development`


## `Data Availability`

### `Research`

- DA benchmarks: we are running benchmarks to compare vs SemiAvid - including: updating and running benchmarks according to needed and requested data and creating a calculator for nomos-da benchmark results. The results can be seen [here](https://gist.github.com/danielSanchezQ/dce309a9ef488b5bcfaad1869f538702) and the DA calculator script can be seen [here](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/658).
- To continue on the point above, we have updated the main [document](https://www.notion.so/Benchmark-and-Scheme-Viability-Analysis-ce94c6a6cb2c4661bca3bacfdf88e048?d=8d3a686af1a34cf797706cae71206d90#917d664fa6c24c3da5f3ad93f1f7aee4) and created separate  sub-tables for NomosDA, Semi-AVID, and fk20. Benchmark results were entered into the tables for ANBC, RB, and CT, and general tables were created. Diagrams for the relevant tables were added to the document. Upon rechecking the results, it was observed that the values were consistent within themselves.

## `Coordination Layer`

### `Research`

- PoC for CL specification: got the 1-to-1 transfer [test](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/93/files#diff-f2ea6731922026e3d88b43b91934936cadcbddb64c62fec78941023f69a2542dR12-R73) running (and passing).
- The python crypto library we've been using so far has been buggy and slow (as in > 1minute startup time and slow ecc math). Tests are very slow to run. Trying to swap it out for some other ecc library, issue is that a lot of the more obscure curves are not well supported in python.

## `Testnet + Insights`

### `Research`

- No updates this week.

### `Development`

- Update current testnet with missing configs for cryptarchia [PR merged](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/656 ): After the introduction of Cryptarchia, Nomos testnet was missing some consensus configuration. Also, exposed required configuration as environment variable. We improved docker build times by defining common base image for Nomos node as well. Also included several minor fixes that were required to deploy on testnet.nomos.tech.
- After the review and report on the testnet state, refined the [plan](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Testnet-99ed9acef3e04b218bbb02ab958c964f) for this iteration.
