## `Cryptarchia`

### `Research`

- No research updates at this moment.

### `Development`

- Stake Relativization Specification - the spec implementation has revealed some bugs in our orphan proof handling logic. Those bugs are still being worked through in this [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/86).
- Refactored Cryptarchia implementation into ledger and consensus crates: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/606).
- Refactored nomos header and block definition so that it's now responsibility of the nomos-core crate: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/609).
- Added Cryptarchia consensus service: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/612).

## `Mixnet (Network Privacy)`

### `Research`

- Mixnet incentivization [document](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Incentivization-6db9731a221b49878224afd916e2b3ac) has been further updated, more precisely the "Rewards" chapter that showcases the mathematic analysis and some of the parameters.
- Focused on researching the problem of mixing transactions by briefly investigating the economic perspective - emphasized on the fact that it can be a main source of the revenue for the mix network. Furthermore, we discussed the privacy perspective and potential negative impact on the privacy due to direct staking.
- Started work on the Message Type Indistinguishability (WIP name) section, where we discuss the potential sizes of the messages, their impact on the throughput, mixnet capacity, and noted a rewarding thing leading to a negative on the privacy. Both this and the previous point can be found in this (WIP) [document](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-with-Staking-c8ec3bfd461f4989b3ebbcf4b4b15324#2e57424c79bd44b19c4c4dd624f544b2).
- Analysis of the fraction of compromised paths in the mix network: optimized code which computes the (asymptotic) lower bound on the probability that the fraction of compromised paths, alpha, belongs to the interval [alpha_0, alpha_1]. The code takes the mixnet size n, sampled from N nodes where M nodes assumed to be adversarial, some initial fraction of compromised paths alpha_0 and outputs minimal fraction of compromised paths alpha_1 such that prob. that fraction of compromised paths belongs to the interval [alpha_0, alpha_1] is 1. The code can be used to design a program which optimizes the number of layers L given some threshold, on the alpha_1, which can be tolerated. However, one has to test if the asymptotic lower bound is suitable for this and gives alpha_1 which is not too loose. Summary of numerical results and simulations is provided in this [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bo7Ch76l6MeTCpii6vGLHhOSIHJULAtPkwJ3x9Ji_Ag/edit?usp=sharing). Summary of analysis is provided in this [document](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-failures-in-the-mix-network-feeef349720842759c59785af71c7c59?pvs=4) and the detailed analysis can be found in the Overleaf [document](https://www.overleaf.com/project/64ff35bb625e39b2cad298e5).

### `Development`

- Integrated mixnet network service for consensus, DA, and mempool: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/610).
- Updated nomos-node integration tests for Mixnet: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/611).
- Refactoring mixnet code: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/614) - and further PRs to be opened soon.

## `Data Availability`

### `Research`

- A case for dispersing the same VID Certificate multiple times was discussed during development, shorter version can be found in this [document](https://www.notion.so/DA-Api-Specification-83000d9c2f3f45b586cd55c5c195cce5#c16d22b2dd1b4cbeae333fbf8ce4e9a2) (VID Related Open Questions chapter).
- BLS threshold details have been added in the relevant [document](https://www.notion.so/BLS-Aggregated-and-Threshold-Signature-5a37ed1db01e4f9594080e1e6a5ef5f4). It was concluded that there could be a significant overhead in communication when using DKG. Instead, an agreement was reached to apply a different solution using aggregate BLS. The relevant changes have been updated in the specification [document](https://www.notion.so/DA-Protocol-Details-4bf3bb62cfb64422ab48b5b60aab6a73). At this stage, we will proceed with this method. To find the best solution for this part, we might ask for support from the VAC team.

### `Development`

- Initial DA API spec structure revised and merged: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/72).
- Tests using DA Protocol specs have been developed. Currently, there are 2 types of tests, which are showcased in the first [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/83) and the second [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/85).
- Finalizing DA verifier protocol specification: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/78).
- Finalizing DA encoding protocol specification: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/76).
- Finalizing DA dispersal protocol specification. Full flow with tests included, using Encoders and Verifiers: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/80). Also, they have gone through reviews and we started discussions in several PRs - [#1](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/80), [#2](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/81), [#3](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/82)
- Added attesters bitfield to DA certificate. Missing compressed bitfield so we can use BLS aggregation of signatures as a threshold scheme: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/81).
- Added certificate verification specification. 

## `Coordination Layer`

### `Research`

- Synchronous Composability with Partial Transactions [document](https://www.notion.so/Synchronous-Composability-with-Partial-Transactions-a2d832ea7d7a4b90b6f582bea64eab7a) containing the findings and research notes has been compiled.
- Progressed with the findings and the discussion on Atomic Asset Transfer w/ Taiga - the full discussion with findings, assumptions, and comments can be seen in this [document](https://www.notion.so/Atomic-Asset-Transfer-w-Taiga-d9d1c29a840a49188270010faa3ac341).
- The Taiga circuit structures have been reviewed again. Relevant comments have been added to the [document](https://www.notion.so/VeriZEXE-vs-Taiga-WIP-3ef9b9def27b4140bd752b0d49cba391).

### `Development`
