# **Nomos weekly report 14th August**
---

## **Network Privacy and Mixnet**

### Research
- Mixnet architecture discussions. Potential agreement on architecture not very different from PoC
- Mixnet preliminary design [https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Architecture-613f53cf11a245098c50af6b191d31d2]
### Development
- Mixnet PoC implementation starting [https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/302]
- Implementation of mixnode: a core module for implementing a mixnode binary
- Implementation of mixnet-client: a client library for mixnet users, such as nomos-node

### **Private PoS**
- No progress this week.

## **Data Availability**
### Research
- Continued analysis of node decay in data availability problem
- Improved upper bound on the probability of the event that data is no longer available given by the (K,N) erasure ECC scheme [https://www.overleaf.com/read/gzqvbbmfnxyp]

### Development
- Library survey: Library used for the benchmarks is not yet ready for requirements, looking for alternatives
- RS & KZG benchmarking for our use case https://www.notion.so/2D-Reed-Solomon-Encoding-KZG-Commitments-benchmarking-b8340382ecc741c4a16b8a0c4a114450
- Study documentation on Danksharding and set of questions for Leonardo [https://www.notion.so/2D-Reed-Solomon-Encoding-KZG-Commitments-benchmarking-b8340382ecc741c4a16b8a0c4a114450]
