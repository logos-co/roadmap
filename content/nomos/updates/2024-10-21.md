## `PPoS / Consensus / DA`

### `Research`

- Blog content: The NomosDA Dispersal, Sampling, and Verification [page](https://www.notion.so/Dispersal-Sampling-and-Verification-10d8f96fb65c80ebb220e0fdad24bbb1) is now complete and is undergoing review.
- Updated the [PoV spec](https://www.notion.so/Proof-of-Validator-Specification-5cd02f594d4d4a66be5e9f1ebf95d7d8?d=1115051dc2f34410bf24ed0e6eac4451#25ae902d598943f4be10314da2a40565) to support slashing and simplified it under the assumption that the input is always only one note.
- Studied two more transaction fee mechanisms: StableFees and Tiered Mechanisms (alternatives to EIP-1559). Notes with comparisons can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Transaction-Fee-Mechanism-Designs-da641345369b44158c213f1cbce22529?pvs=25).
- Added a [review](https://www.notion.so/NomosDA-Fee-Market-1078f96fb65c800dbaceff1c728f0e1e?pvs=25) of the DA market on Ethereum.
- Ran Cryptarchia MEV simulations:  **Economically Rational Validators in Cryptarchia v2**, **Cryptarchia v2 Fork Choice Rule Applied to Cryptarchia (C1-weighted)**, **Slotless Cryptarchia**, and **Cryptarchia GHOST**. All simulations were completed, and the results are summarized [here](https://www.notion.so/Analyzing-Cryptarchia-Improvements-1188f96fb65c804aab14c68f191976fb?pvs=4#11f8f96fb65c8081b61ec146a70d9311). The conclusion is that GHOST performs the best among the improvements we've tested.

### `Development`

- [PR #826](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/826) (Node) - Added handling for automatic reconnections in the dispersal executor behavior. This should significantly improve network stability for executors. After a few iterations, we found the correct approach.
- [PR #828](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/828) (Node) - Removed unnecessary extra channels from the consensus adapter.
- [PR #832](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/832) (Node) - Tests: General configuration and multiple nodes. Refactored integration tests to have a general configuration for common services in validator and executor nodes.
- [PR #835](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/835) (Node) - Started the integration of the Coordination Layer in the node by adding the transaction definition format and cleaning the code by removing Carnot leftovers.

## `Mixnet`

### `Research`

- [Updated](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Incentivization-6db9731a221b49878224afd916e2b3ac) the Mixnet economy.
- Clarified the specs for the following: [Protocol name](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Network-Introduction-1058f96fb65c808abb1dcb33cc2ed417?d=1228f96fb65c80b6ad04001ce72de07c&pvs=4#cd47542a625242518dac5493ff6e7ed3), [DEF (drop message emission frequency)](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Network-Tier-1-Persistent-Transmission-Module-10b8f96fb65c807cb1e8f92a7f41a771?d=11f8f96fb65c8006895f001cd67a8e18&pvs=4#11c8f96fb65c801399dfe3047cde87a9), [Tolerance in frequency monitoring](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Network-Tier-1-Persistent-Transmission-Module-10b8f96fb65c807cb1e8f92a7f41a771?d=1208f96fb65c8073bfcd001cf577f743&pvs=4#11c8f96fb65c8053876bcce50adae763), and [Cover message creation probability](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Network-Tier-3-Cover-Traffic-Module-10b8f96fb65c80cab153de10115e0023?d=1228f96fb65c80dc91bc001c301d9614&pvs=4#1218f96fb65c804f9644c1203bbdb695).
- We renamed the network "Blend" instead of "Mix." This will be treated as a placeholder until a better-suited name is found. The term "Blend" is technically accurate, as the network's purpose is to allow nodes to blend with each other, making it harder to distinguish between them.
- Updated several documents to reflect recent changes aimed at bandwidth and latency limitations, including the [Nomos Blend Network Introduction](https://notion.so/Nomos-Blend-Network-Introduction-1058f96fb65c808abb1dcb33cc2ed417), [Nomos Blend Network Tier 2 Message Blending Module](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Blend-Network-Tier-2-Message-Blending-Module-1208f96fb65c80e5bcb9df6e27472339), and [Nomos Blend Network Tier 3 Cover Traffic Module](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Blend-Network-Tier-3-Cover-Traffic-Module-10b8f96fb65c80cab153de10115e0023).

### `Development`

- [PR #822](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/822) and [PR #823](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/823) (Node) - Added the mix service.
- [PR #824](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/824) and [PR #829](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/829) (Node) - Integrated the mix service into the node.

## `Coordination Layer`

### `Research`

- Blog content: Started the IPA (Inner Product Arguments) [page](https://www.notion.so/Inner-Product-Arguments-IPAs-1218f96fb65c801980a7fd00cfd79d5c). IPAs are a type of operation on vectors that can be combined with Pedersen Commitments to create polynomial commitments.
- Started writing the [CL Ledger spec](https://www.notion.so/Ledger-Spec-02495dcb420a45df943a27f72d10daa5?pvs=4#563209330e8e46bc8815da84966e538f) to include recent decisions and added details on its workings. Also added a [requirements comparison](https://www.notion.so/Preliminary-Research-Global-State-Representation-1128f96fb65c80f998fef97742f8e1e4?pvs=4#1238f96fb65c80399fd8db45408c5a0a) in the preliminary research.
- Started writing the [Private Atomic Cross-Zone Transaction](https://www.notion.so/Native-Zones-Proof-of-Concept-v0-2-Private-Atomic-Transfer-1228f96fb65c8024b92ce44c7e11c0ef) specification.
- Reviewed an epoch-based nullifier database solution, addressing the challenge of storing nullifiers and preventing database bloat. Relevant notes were added to [the document](https://www.notion.so/Epoch-based-Nullifier-Database-1238f96fb65c80769531c12cb9d49a19).
