## `network privacy and mixnet`

### `research`

### `development`

- Deciding the default # of layers (in parallel, devs can parameterize it.)
- Deciding the cover traffic strategy
- Then, we need to decide the default rate of cover traffics (aka. lambda params)
- [Categorizing TODOs](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2#9d5f1c09163746b2ae5f42be9ba77efa)

## `testnet`

### `development`

- Merged [Prometheus metrics service](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/522)

## `private PoS`

### `research`

- We consider leader election in PoS observed over some period of time by an adversary who wants to learn its stake with high “accuracy” and high “confidence”.
- For the probability of stake greater than some threshold derived rigorous lower and upper bounds on this probability.
- For the same probability considered an asymptotic long-time regime and developed a mathematical framework for this regime. 
- Verification of above results by simulations is in progress. 
- The above will be a part of the  framework which will be used to get a more accurate estimate of the number of layers which are required to reduce anonymity failures in the mixnet. More details provided [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xvgmfchdhgzh#acd15d)
- Analyzed how stake splitting affected leader rates in Crypsinous: Stake Splitting in Praos

## `data availability`

### `research`

- Designed a new super-commitment structure and explained it [here](https://www.notion.so/1-5d-SuperCommit-4a81bdaf19e64d53a4a158f38c6b6077). After some discussions, we agreed that  prover cannot temper the column entries by adding and subtracting some values but he can reorder the column entries. The proof does not guarantee column ordering. Solution methods for this were discussed, but since the focus was on a different structure design, this development was postponed for now.
- Thought of a different design and explained it [here](https://www.notion.so/New-Idea-cddf055558f84137ba19f01ea8fe15c7). The main idea of the design is to take a commitment of commitments. As a result of the investigations, the structure is thought to be working. Cryptographic proof will be worked on.
- The newly designed structures were compared with these existing schemes. It is thought that our current design will provide the whole advantages of [Avail](https://blog.availproject.org/a-guide-to-selecting-the-right-data-availability-layer/ ).

### `development`

- Continuing DA mock implementation - splitting it into reviewable parts
- [1D benchmarking](https://github.com/logos-co/semiavidpr-experiments/tree/kzg-1D-benchmarks) 

### `miscellaneous`

- The Whitepaper now contains a whole new section on Light Nodes.
- Carnot's role in Nomos has been updated.
- Explanations about privacy have been expanded and adapted to include the notion of resiliency.
- Added other sections, like Multiple Base Layers and others related to Light Nodes.
- Added new diagrams
