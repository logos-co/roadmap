### `Research`

- Major effort was devoted to advancing the Ordering Experiments descriptions to cover more complex scenarios, to unblock the progress of simulations. The work was successful and all scenarios have been described, discussed, and implemented. The whole section contains six generalized experiments that cover three different topological settings with two mix node behaviors. The set of parameters was adjusted to be able to finish on time based on a set of benchmarks that we ran. More on that [here](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Mix-Queueing-Mechanism-Experimentation-Methodology-d629af5a2d43473c9ec9ba191f6d904d?d=659b699941264fb3b7bb2c80b53e5c97#57368ca1503443c6b03e76ecbea3d1a6).
- The Experiments Tracking [document](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Mix-Experiments-Tracking-ad7e2b8f632c4b60a20a2ff65fd03cc9) was updated to include new experiments. A decision was made to run experiments from the most comprehensive and computationally heavy (6th) down to the lightest (1st). This way we can consider making an analysis quicker and wait for supportive results.
- Implemented and ran the Ordering Measurements. Implementation can be found at [this branch](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations/tree/mixnet-rs-single). A PR hasn't been opened yet since some parts need to be cleaned up, and we wanted to quickly implement the new experiments. However, we took the time to check that the experiments work as intended. Also, ran the [benchmark](https://www.notion.so/Ordering-Experiments-Benchmarks-d3964323f8b4487f8e0556a5c86bf2f2) to estimate the duration of experiments.
- We are currently running all the experiments (in order from heaviest to lightest). All of them are expected to be done by 6th September.
- Analysis of latency in the Nomos mix network: considered a node sending a message to all N−1 nodes of the random network. A message traveling from a node to its neighbor is delayed by the amount of time spent in the out-queue plus the connection link latency. Defined the distance between nodes i and j as the minimum latency of a message sent from node i to node j. For node 1, the maximum overall distance to N−1 nodes is the latency of broadcast. Using this definition, considered the latency of broadcast on the network with the topology of a complete graph. The latter is a special case of a random regular graph. Developed code to compute the latency of broadcast for networks with the topology of random regular graphs. This work is summarized in this [document](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-Nomos-Mixnet-Anonymous-Communication-AC-System-c97d73a7b8894cf7830e8345f0cc37a4?pvs=4#1323b5075097461a80ebc03a0da2fa4c). Analysis of a message sent from a node in a random regular graph is currently in progress.

### `Research`

- Continued development of the [code](https://github.com/vacp2p/token-economics/tree/cryptarchia-selfish-behavior/Nomos/selfish_behavior) to study the selfish behavior of stakers (within the wealth concentration context).
- Integrated the [statistical analysis](https://www.notion.so/Does-Crypsinous-Leader-Election-Function-lead-to-wealth-concentration-in-PoS-b81f07a791b745438443f51f00ac258f#c6b214ff57a14885b062ef4b14f9f877) of the "follow the protocol" study (within the wealth concentration context).

### `Research`

- Concluded the [VM analysis](https://www.notion.so/Preliminary-Research-ZKVM-s-for-CL-Design-310996a4924149b986f28ed7d387a363): after reviewing the candidate zkVMs, we decided that continuing with Risc0 is the most suitable option at this stage for our Native Zone needs. SP1, Jolt, Cairo-VM, and Nexus will be among the VMs we continue to monitor, but Risc0 appears to be the best choice for now.
- [PR #31](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/31) and [PR #33](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/33) (PoCs) - performed optimization of native zones: use basepoint as the blinding point and provide state roots instead of whole state.
- [PR #32](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/32) (PoCs) - built isolated proof scenarios to aid benchmarking work.
- [PR #34](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/34) (PoCs) - aggregated input/output proofs into a single partial transaction proof.
- [PR #35](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/35) (PoCs) - moved the blinding to the partial transaction level instead of blinding each note value individually.
- [PR #36](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/36) (PoCs) - switched from Pederson balance commitments to hash balance commitments.
- [PR #37](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/pull/37) (PoCs) - modelled zone transaction log with MMR.
