## Nomos weekly report 21st Oct

(delayed as I was on holidays and then took me some time to clarify some things with the team)

### Network Privacy and Mixnet

- Improved the mixnet implementation based on latest discussion. https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/307
- Base implementation of Mixnet PoC: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/302
- Refactor to encapsulate message body creation&write&read: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/308
- New issues related to mixnet: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amixnet

### Private PoS

- Updated draft addressing comments related to shielded and transparent transaction types.
- Defined an opportunistic voting problem.
- Continuing analysis on zCash transaction's construction.
- This is currently the project that is going slowest and needs more attention going forward. It's also the most complex and with the most unknowns.

### Simulations app

- Graceful shutdown of simulations.
- Created a new repository for simulations configurations and test results: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations
- Updates and discussed test runs: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations/pull/3
- Changes to support CSV format output of simulation data: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/304 and https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/306
- Minor issue on integration tests fixed: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/315

### Data Availability Sampling

- Studied RS+KZG in context of our DA architecture.
- RS: basic encoding/decoding lib. Created a basic wrapper around reed-solomon-encoding library to work with arbitrary bytearrays with the simples API possible. Created basic tests and docs as well.
- KZG: basic commitment + proof creation, also proof verification lib. Same here, created a simplistic API that abstract from the confusing types in the underlaying used library.
- Created a simplistic API for RS: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/303
- Created a simplistic API for KZG: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/309
