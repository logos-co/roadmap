Nomos weekly report
================

### Network implementation and Mixnet:
#### Research
- Researched the Nym mixnet architecture in depth in order to design our prototype architecture.
      (Link: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/issues/273#issuecomment-1661386628)
- Discussions about how to manage the mixnet topology.
      (Link: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/issues/273#issuecomment-1665101243)
#### Development
- Implemented a prototype for building a Sphinx packet, mixing packets at the first hop of gossipsub with 3 mixnodes (+ encryption + delay), raw TCP connections between mixnodes, and the static entire mixnode topology.
      (Link: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/288)
- Added support for libp2p in tests.

- Added support for libp2p in nomos node.

### Private PoS:
#### Research
- Worked on PPoS design and addressed potential metadata leakage due to staking and rewarding.
- Focus on potential bribery attacks and privacy reasoning, but not much progress yet.
- Stopped work on Accountability mechanism and PPoS efficiency due to prioritizing bribery attacks.

### Carnot:
#### Research
- Addressed two solutions for the bribery attack. Proposals pending.
- Work on accountability against attacks in Carnot including Slashing mechanism for attackers is paused at the moment.
- Modeled data decimation using a specific set of parameters and derived equations related to it.
- Proposed solutions to address bribery attacks without compromising the protocol's scalability.

### Data Availability Sampling (VID):
#### Research
- Analyzed data decimation in data availability problem.
      (Link: https://www.overleaf.com/read/gzqvbbmfnxyp)
- DA benchmarks and analysis for data commitments and encoding. This confirms that (for now), we are on the right path.
- Explored the idea of node sharding: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03331 (taken from Celestia), but discarded it because it doesn't fit our architecture.

#### Testing and Node development:
- Fixes and enhancements made to nomos-node.
      (Link: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/282)
      (Link: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/289)
      (Link: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/293)
      (Link: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/295)
- Ran simulations with 10K nodes.
- Updated integration tests in CI to use waku or libp2p network.
      (Link: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/290)
- Fix for the node throughput during simulations.
