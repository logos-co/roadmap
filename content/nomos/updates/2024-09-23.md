## `P2P Privacy`

### `Research`

- Added a preliminary research note: [Nomos Mix on Libp2p](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-on-Libp2p-Implementation-d8b2827c2ba4429a81ce875747934319).
- Started a major rewrite of the Nomos Mix design. The motivation for this is that the main document is not well-maintained and has become difficult to read, so there is a need to extract the most important parts of the design and clean up the entire documentation.
- Analysis of latency in the Nomos mix network: Considered the probability that the latency of a broadcast is greater than some threshold t, i.e., the probability of the upper “tail.” For a network of size N, with a topology of a random regular graph with connectivity ccc, numerical simulations for q=12q=\frac{1}{2}q=21​ suggest that the probability of the upper tails is a monotonic decreasing function of graph connectivity c. This analysis assumes that message delay is governed by a Geometric distribution with parameter q, meaning a message is removed from the out-queue with probability q, and that there is a constant delay in communication links. Comparing the same probability in networks with topologies of random regular graphs and trees suggests that the latter is an upper bound on the former. This work is summarized [here](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-Nomos-Mixnet-Anonymous-Communication-AC-System-c97d73a7b8894cf7830e8345f0cc37a4?pvs=4#10a8f96fb65c80588561c1c64f4d9149).

### `Development`

- [PR #765](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/765) (Node) - Implemented the libp2p stack for Nomos Mix. Currently under review.

## `Data Availability`

### `Research`

- Added a NomosDA docs Introduction page [draft](https://www.notion.so/Introduction-1008f96fb65c80568c65c2cfc4187f92).

### `Development`

- [PR #764](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/764) (Node) - Nomos CLI dispersal and sampling testing: finalized sampling testing and added fixes and tests for CLI dispersal code. Nomos CLI acts as one of the nodes in the network using its secure key for DA communications.
- [PR #764](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/764) (Node) - Replication testing and fixes: piped replicated payloads to the validator. Peers now dial to each other if they are in the same subnet. Integration tests are running 4 subnets with 8 nodes and a replication factor of 2.

## `PPoS/Consensus`

### `Research`

- Notes on the problems encountered with merging blocks and potential solutions have been taken and added [here](https://www.notion.so/Merging-Problem-648706090686486ba2bf04027ce0ea38?pvs=25). Due to privacy concerns, the cryptographic solution mentioned in Solution 3 is not feasible.
- [Notes](https://www.notion.so/Postponed-Selfish-Proposing-in-PoS-b109e3ae8736401caaef1633940e3b73) about selfish proposing in PoS have been added.
- [Analyzed](https://www.notion.so/Token-Design-Comparables-94986e5741384d3591e6f0e375d0926d) the token design of comparable projects.
- Wrote, shared, and discussed a [solution](https://www.notion.so/Solo-Play-Is-Not-The-Way-1048f96fb65c8017bbcfd72053b9063e?pvs=4) for the "lazy nodes" problem in our consensus.

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `Coordination Layer`

### `Research`

- Moved the Stwo repo to a dedicated nomos-pocs [branch](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-pocs/tree/Stwo_wrapper).
- In the Stwo implementation, work continued on the DEEP FRI details for Circle STARK, specifically for the verifier part. A general note on the structure of the DEEP FRI protocol was added to the [document](https://www.notion.so/FRI-Protocol-f7870e74665848238d911dd72e0d3c1f?pvs=25) prepared earlier for FRI.
- Replaced Rapidsnark with Tachyon for the Risc0 wrapper. The results were not useful, but they may be improved in the future, allowing us to reuse the implementation. Implementation, measurements, and discussions are [available on Notion](https://www.notion.so/Tachyon-in-risc0-wrapper-1078f96fb65c809599d6f4c88ca60eb7).
- Started the [Ingonyama Icicle review](https://www.notion.so/Ingonyama-Icicle-1048f96fb65c80aca18ac1f67ec977e0), identifying potential future improvements for DA.
- The wrapper SageMath script is running the entire verifier, except for the last remaining part, which is FRI. We added an [explanation on the DEEP method](https://www.notion.so/Preliminary-Research-Stwo-Wrapper-82f900dce90d4532be844c477b8cc618?pvs=4#441a90ac78454b268c3eb96828ccd205) used for building the script.
