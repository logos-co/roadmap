## **Nomos weekly report**

### Milestone 1: Network Privacy and Mixnet

#### **Research**
- A Mixnet PoC was conducted to gauge end-to-end latency, revealing a slight latency increase when utilizing mixnet. Several potential optimization areas have been identified.

#### **Development**
- Various enhancements for the Mixnet have been developed, including the addition of delays for Sphinx packets, auto port for integration tests, and introducing a graceful shutdown for mixnode elements.
- There's an ongoing shift from channels to streams in mixnet message handling.
- Refactoring of Mixnet Node & Client: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/320
- Mixnet PoC Architecture Documents: https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-and-Network-Privacy-Architecture-613f53cf11a245098c50af6b191d31d2
- Mixnet Measurements Documentation: https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Measurements-551ade11ae4d44ca9f3d947ea6950c67
- Sphinx Packet Delay Support: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/321
- Auto Port for Tests: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/327
- Mixnet Criterion Measurement: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/328
- Graceful Shutdown for Mixnet: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/330

### Milestone 2: Private PoS

#### **Research**
- Discussions were held about token-engineering and staking in private settings, resulting in documentation that delves into the validation and delegation aspects of PPoS. Current considerations involve the integration of the ZeroCash/zCash construction into the staking model.

### Milestone 3: Data Availability Sampling (RS, KZG)

#### **Research**
- Limitations discovered during RS and KZG implementation, notably with RS library scalability issues and bls12_381 curve finite field challenges. Found KZG libraries are primarily designed for Ethereum, which constrains the blob size.
- Benchmarks for KZG implementation were carried out, and simulation runs were conducted for different configurations.
- Node decay in relation to data availability was analyzed, leading to the derivation of an equation for understanding node averages in the network.
#### **Development**
- KZG Library: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/325
- KZG Base Layer initial approach: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/309
- Detailed KZG Operation Benchmarks: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/tree/da-kzg-benches
