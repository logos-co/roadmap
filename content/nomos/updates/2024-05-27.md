## `P2P Privacy`

### `Research`

- Security of Mixing over Broadcasting Channel [document](https://www.notion.so/Security-of-Mixing-over-Broadcasting-Channel-e09184fa14614d78829f76fdb4aa65d3#642beedb44674143ba25e5e21c23f860) has been updated with new details. We mapped the first few cases that we want to analyze through simulations; the Partial View section was added to the document. Analysis of partial view is much more complex than the Global View case, and the Global View does not seem to leak significant information. Thus, the observer in Partial View will need to play a probability game to learn something. However, there are routing attacks that can increase the field of view of the observer, so we should not neglect this case. We have also started working on the analysis of an alternative to broadcasting disseminationâ€”peer to peer.
- Analysis of random structures generated by the mix gadget, such as properties of hypergraphs, etc. was performed and summary can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-mix-gadget-6246ab47a8e34ac0bc7b561d32680e34#94785a745fe04b12a6b2a5f15ef5f04b).

### `Development`

- P2P Privacy Simulation: all simulation reports can be found in [P2P Privacy: Simulation Results](https://www.notion.so/P2P-Privacy-Simulation-Results-5715774a1d674381aacd2a7544fc21d1?pvs=4).
- Posted a report: [P2P Privacy: Bandwidth Usage Patterns](https://www.notion.so/P2P-Privacy-Bandwidth-Usages-2e64aa042e014e289e52d5651492e156?pvs=4). Bandwidth was measured for both 1-to-all broadcasting and gossiping, with various parameters (mix layers & cover traffic) changed, so that we can gain insight into how bandwidth increases as parameters change. The document also shows how the simulation works. In short, we now have a framework to measure the performance of the protocol. The next simulation is evaluating anonymity with changing cover traffic patterns to find the optimal cover traffic strategy that guarantees a reasonable level of anonymity in the protocol. 
- One more (WIP) report can be found in [(WIP) P2P Privacy: Anonymity](https://www.notion.so/WIP-P2P-Privacy-Anonymity-ecbcb7ea509b4337b66de515d900dd50?pvs=4). We are currently using the number of messages staying in each node over time as a metric to evaluate the level of anonymity. Although it may not be the best metric, it's probably the most intuitive one for now.

## `Data Availability`

### `Research`

- The details of the Semi-AVID protocol have been studied, the relevant implementation has been reviewed, and the [document](https://www.notion.so/Semi-AVID-Protocol-Details-b26780dc2972485190bb448b7d52a938) prepared.
- The benchmark [document](https://www.notion.so/Comparison-Table-9c19725300184cacb70fa1eb9f9a3962) for the results of NomosDA and Semi-AVID has been prepared. Values for Semi-AVID have been calculated and added to the table. We also computed the values for NomosDA. Based on feedback received, the table will be updated and recreated in regard to the latest values.

### `Development`

- KZGRS certificate implementation ([PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/651) merged), including: Certificate implementation required for verifier and indexer services, adding of DST tag to Nomos spec and the implementation ([Nomos spec PR merged](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/94)) and VID and Metadata for KZGRS DA protocol.
- Added DA Verifier service improvements ([PR merged](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/650)).

## `PPoS/Consensus`

### `Research`

- Expanded/improved explanations of the results in the "Does Crypsinous Leader Election Function Lead to Wealth Concentration in PoS" [document](https://www.notion.so/Does-Crypsinous-Leader-Election-Function-lead-to-wealth-concentration-in-PoS-b81f07a791b745438443f51f00ac258f). Also provided a single Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/vacp2p/token-economics/blob/1c2d31414878bad7cc50d02d0fc895d96e1e2062/Nomos/cryptarchia_leader_election/cryptarchia_leader_election_gpu.ipynb) to replicate all computations.

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `Coordination Layer`

### `Research`

- CL use case implementation in Python: made some progress towards a 1 input, 1 output test case for CL. [PR #93](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/93/commits/9e1fb74f93e1d2ca9d2571effcb737d1cc23cf64), but it's not yet working. Certain CL design bugs were found during implementation, which led to changing some parts of the specification.
- Minor crisis on prover key sizes preventing thin clients from generating a transaction. But the general opinion is that what we settled on should work for us (lazy prover key derivation).
