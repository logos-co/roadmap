## `network privacy and mixnet`

### `research`

- Started the investigation of the mixnet participation problem. We have looked at Nym and how they constructed a mechanism for populating the mixnet. We extracted the design and described it in detail [here](https://www.notion.so/Populating-Mixnet-in-Nym-0777455a18c5431f8fa2c56a2e1154b5). In short, they require the mixnet nodes to register on-chain; once there, they are randomly selected using weight as stake (plus delegated stake), and rewards are paid based on the mix node performance.

### `development`

- No development updates.

## `testnet`

### `development`

- Fixed the race for nomos log service [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/577).
- Nomos-cli: Integrated the explorer into the nomos-cli in one [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/578) with the integration tests coming in [another one](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/tree/integration-for-explorer) once it is unblocked (blocked due to the `sled` dependency).

## `cryptarchia`

### `research`

- New details have been added to the Cryptarchia specification: [the epoch transition](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/63), [nonce specification](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/64), [orphan proofs validation](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/69), [leader lottery VRF details](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/68), [leader coin evolution](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/65). With these additions, the [Cryptarchia v1](https://www.notion.so/Cryptarchia-Specifications-a11d16a37c81452a8c89a94ced3ceef5) is now ready internally.
- The impact of approximate total stake (total stake underestimation/overestimation) [document](https://www.notion.so/Impacts-of-Approximate-Total-Stake-1b9a248b222449c68c70fb645a733b03) has been finalized and summarized. Awaiting internal review. For the mathematical analysis and results, please check the [Overleaf document](https://www.overleaf.com/project/656dfacf4929b4a3d6d2ffe5).
- We have considered adversarial statistical inference of relative stake when the Ouroboros Crypsinous lottery function is used in the leader election process while assuming that only a fraction of election results are observed. For this scenario, we also derived a statistical estimator of relative stake. The analysis of the (naive) statistical estimator is currently in progress. The summary of this work is provided [here](https://www.notion.so/De-anonymisation-of-relative-stake-5b48f86bba3845c98f9b16f952307998) while the detailed analysis can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/project/656dfacf4929b4a3d6d2ffe5).
- [Tokenomics Design Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Tokenomics-Design-Canvas-e62e78ee0f8c4a719d1f6ffb08574241) has been updated with new objectives & requirements in addition to new sections.
- Added a chapter about the "stake relativization algorithm" to the "Does Crypsinousâ€™ Leader Election Function lead to wealth concentration in PoS?" [document](https://www.notion.so/Does-Crypsinous-Leader-Election-Function-lead-to-wealth-concentration-in-PoS-b81f07a791b745438443f51f00ac258f#1df422f6cc204cb8b362f41cda260b8b).

### `development`

- No updates, heavily in research.

## `data availability`

### `research`

- The [DA Layer Comparison Table](https://www.notion.so/DA-Layer-Comparison-Table-5848811f0af042e2b24c10d3cea9b0a8) has been finalized, after several reviews and additional efforts.
- [Data Availability Specification](https://www.notion.so/Data-Availability-Specification-4dd57aa0a212490c82b09d22bd2b9c30) has been updated according to recent comments.
- [DA protocol details page](https://www.notion.so/DA-Protocol-Details-4bf3bb62cfb64422ab48b5b60aab6a73) has been created with the protocol diagrams included in the latest iteration.
- The DA specification has been updated with new details. To see them and, in general, the progress of the DA specification, refer to this [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/70).

### `development`

- Due to the focus on the DA Specification, protocol details, and the comparison table, no development updates.

## `miscellaneous`

- Blog coming this week and will be posted on the Nomos website (with the link on our X/Twitter).
