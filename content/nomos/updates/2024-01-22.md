## `network privacy and mixnet`

### `research`

- One of the last pieces of the mixnet specification: "Defining topology update and entropy injection in a clear way" - we are close to a solution and will include new findings next week. To see the current proposal and differences being discussed (for example architecting the consensus and mixnet interaction) please check the [GitHub PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/51#discussion_r1457675581). Code review is also in progress. 
### `development`

- Tested [libp2p stream protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/tree/master/examples/stream) for the mixclient->mixnode and mixnode->mixnode communication. Concluded that's very simple and appropriate for our case because it's the fundamental protocol that is used for other libp2p protocols such as DHT. That's basically not very different from the naive communication implementation over QUIC or TCP. 
- Completed several PRs (with code-review as well) [Topology](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/44), [Sphinx packet construction](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/47), [Packet delays](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/49), [Mix client Poisson emission](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/49). 
- Designed the updated Nomos Rust [project structure](https://viewer.diagrams.net/index.html?tags=%7B%7D&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=mixnet-components.drawio#R5Vpbc5s6EP41nmkfkgFxcx5bJzntmbaTTuac0%2FRNBhmUCMSR5Ft%2FfSUj7tjxFTvTJ0urXQG73367CA%2BsUbz4i8E0%2BkoDRAbACBYD63YAgGkbjvxRkmUm8bxhJggZDrRSKXjEv5AWGlo6xQHiNUVBKRE4rQt9miTIFzUZZIzO62oTSupXTWGIWoJHH5K29D8ciCiTDh2jlH9COIzyK5uGXolhrqwFPIIBnVdE1t3AGjFKRTaKFyNElPNyv2R292tWixtjKBHbGPwPl5%2Bewf2vny8enBF3OZ8F9pXeZQbJVD8wFzAJIKEJUl5lUEjvZ%2FcvlrlTGJ0mAVL7GgPr4zzCAj2m0FercwkDKYtETOTMlEMCx4g8UI4FpomU%2BfJ%2BEZMLM8QElp7%2B0lAQVO0ACQ471T%2FohTEVgsZyQT%2BCXEaLtb4xC49LqCIaI8GWUkUbAFcHSaPUyoM2L2NuuhrKUSXeIAcC1DgLi73LUMiBjkZ3ZAIcj3%2Bmhvh3cRvw59E3HE3%2BvjLtVmgSGlN%2BxRGbYf%2BNRKUVgo5ArY2KPaxHBVjtqNh5pKpRsexTRQW0EwZPVmHAK2PJQYhzqK9UjQ4KJK%2FoKWUioiFNILkrpR%2Fr8St1vlDl%2BlXUnpEQS02ScCpoPaZogcUPba7GT2p87ejZ7aKydLvMJ4l0y498AzWpWKlpabaa5XYB5NHqXvcCU4GSV%2FGUwW4tmDidMh9tSiNdMyALkdgUWI0YFaaN2GSIQIFn9fJw%2FOxvwWwAXCKU4%2FFMDkM1TJCYU%2Fai3DDz83V5uYpKh9U7LhiC8QCMVHmlnMtSOh3LMZW%2Blz%2Ff%2F%2Fk8ep%2FbjVlzp%2Bb%2Bh5DQETjCAXWOKDijwhEFb1Q54mTE7bRLKkqC1XP6L0i0ebtPZijY4Kmy0s0M%2B%2BccOHYqadMHiuWtlKH3nO7Q51tkSa%2Btyqh%2BYAwuK2qpUuC7X6cESbZjCZniGQ8gAKMFI0VgqvtNKaHheQvMtVfFkbERR0WFMa5BUVWeqotrSszBAHyV9O0tgaqBIB9gCLTNbtjdFXKuYdX7Ua%2FR2zf0vZuN%2BnWIltb57dDJhCMxaDLfMWDs%2FVGN0Okha7oX1aeAFkvFeOETjFb4WrUlF9YgWDcdr3Zmnw2Cu6ZBuGfIn%2F1JfYLVT5%2FgGWtaxCP3Ceuuc9I%2B4az8au7Dr8Zu%2FHowvI7WBfT05jc8b%2BKDvTo7b6fO7kg1c9sAH79m7tfUNd4jLHdzU2cNrU36p%2BETq6ugJzRAF1LOXWeLcm70Wc7Nm%2FMmrDGs07Bh95C0assHxLB0oTq2O5Cp7beVyJ7n1THo7JjITg%2BJ3P58IBO5PDxoHu9dQm573uu5fdNrardfb%2BqteszDN9OnVxK%2Fp2MYc%2BvD9y3TWuPkyrh2wVBzwb4vBz2cfbRrKU6e1Udq%2BajSxTQ96yHefs37xWHnwrr39ocbnyaSNPiUX0gH1TwQAd65D0TM9omIajp1Vu7tqwkmJM8lnQbbvXhs70vLuLTDJdD%2BbpD9bYDgcQrSwzx6avd1fbw7lvtU0S7%2Ba5NRfPmPJevuNw%3D%3D) for mixnet v1.
- [Analyzed](https://www.notion.so/rust-libp2p-QUIC-transport-analysis-6a6acf6f02424f0ab7ba30ecb6b8647b) the rust-libp2p QUIC transport in terms of configuration and implementation details.
## `testnet`

### `development`

- Removed the `async-trait` from the [node](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/561) as well as [Overwatch](https://github.com/logos-co/Overwatch/pull/33). 
- Grafana and related services addition to the testnet ([new PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/564)).
- Preparation for demo chat app bot, ability to send data from file, non-interactively ([new PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/565)).
- [Prune Carnot old block PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/559) has been completed and is currently in review.
- Added a [test](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/563) for big blobs dissemination.
- Limited the number of in-flight requests performed by the chat app to avoid using too many descriptors - more details [here](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/562).

## `cryptarchia`

### `research`

- Updated the wealth concentration analysis with the new [chapter]([https://www.notion.so/Does-Crypsinous-Leader-Election-Function-lead-to-wealth-concentration-in-PoS-b81f07a791b745438443f51f00ac258f?pvs=4#1df422f6cc204cb8b362f41cda260b8b](https://www.notion.so/Does-Crypsinous-Leader-Election-Function-lead-to-wealth-concentration-in-PoS-b81f07a791b745438443f51f00ac258f?pvs=4#1df422f6cc204cb8b362f41cda260b8b) about stake relativization algorithm. The [section](https://www.notion.so/Does-Crypsinous-Leader-Election-Function-lead-to-wealth-concentration-in-PoS-b81f07a791b745438443f51f00ac258f#ca7aa03a7b9541849b71843a46c883c7) about known total stake is also in progress.
- [Stake relativization](https://www.notion.so/Stake-Relativization-65f5ed5522b64c36b625652023318d88#5ac8c8ead49d4bc7b9ab742bafd91257) specification is complete.
- Set up an [analytical framework](https://www.overleaf.com/project/656dfacf4929b4a3d6d2ffe5) which will be used to study the impact of using the (biased) total stake estimator on the leader election process. The central object of this framework is the joint probability distribution of two copies of the election process with the same (random) sampling noise, the same stake but different values of the total stake.

### `development`

- No updates, heavily in research.
## `data availability`

### `research`

- [DA API specification](https://www.notion.so/DA-Api-Specification-83000d9c2f3f45b586cd55c5c195cce5) is written (prone to change due to active discussions)
- [DA Layer Comparison article](https://www.notion.so/DA-Layer-Comparison-Table-5848811f0af042e2b24c10d3cea9b0a8) is finished: . Protocols were explained in more detail. Tables have been updated. To see the raw updated data on its own refer to this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I2hk69hWLVXaATC5048tLcw2qUTjiZORIzL0y90PTLg/edit#gid=0).

### `development`

- [DA implementation plan](https://www.notion.so/Preparation-for-DA-API-c3ec5933851b4ff48ede5da1cff25638) is written (with active discussions it is prone to change)

## `miscellaneous`

- Devised a plan to take action for Nomos marketing and comms strategy: devised a couple of WIP docs (strategic [one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18YokFwgz-LgEsfhkuSCYpm26DdXK0e80iDNtS6otHE8/edit) and mission [one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L4Eebj-ol6sO_IEZGa9P5fte54luTZA1L_IYX4sHNN8/edit#heading=h.m5q5sieqfyk6)). We will start compiling our resources to help out the comms team with "ammo" for the Twitter and other social media.
- Carnot paper is currently being reviewed. Team feedback collected, several issues (for example of administrative and legal nature) were raised and will be addressed.
