**Research**

- Milestone 1: Understanding Data Availability (DA) Problem
 - High-level exploration and discussion on data availability problems in a collaborative offsite meeting in Paris.
 - Explored the necessity and key challenges associated with DA.
 - In-depth study of Verifiable Information Dispersal (VID) as it relates to data availability.
 - **Blocker:** The experimental tests for our specific EC scheme are pending, which is blocking progress to make final decision on KZG + commitments for our architecture.
- Milestone 2: Privacy for Proof of Stake (PoS)
 - Analyzed the capabilities and limitations of mixnets, specifically within the context of timing attacks in private PoS.
 - Invested time in understanding timing attacks and how Nym mixnet caters to these challenges.
 - Reviewed the Crypsinous paper to understand its privacy vulnerabilities, notably the issue with probabilistic leader election and the vulnerability of anonymous broadcast channels to timing attacks.

**Development**

- Milestone 1: Mixnet and Networking
 - Initiated integration of libp2p to be used as the full node's backend, planning to complete in the next phase.
 - Begun planning for the next steps for mixnet integration, with a focus on understanding the components of the Nym mixnet, its problem-solving mechanisms, and the potential for integrating some of its components into our codebase.
- Milestone 2: Simulation Application
 - Completed pseudocode for Carnot Simulator, created a test pseudocode, and provided a detailed description of the simulation. The relevant resources can be found at the following links:
   - Carnot Simulator pseudocode (https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/blob/Carnot-Simulation/carnot/carnot_simulation_psuedocode.py)
   - Test pseudocode (https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/blob/Carnot-Simulation/carnot/test_carnot_simulation.py)
   - Description of the simulation (https://www.notion.so/Carnot-Simulation-c025dbab6b374c139004aae45831cf78)
 - Implemented simulation network fixes and warding improvements, and increased the run duration of integration tests. The corresponding pull requests can be accessed here:
