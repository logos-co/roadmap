## `network privacy and mixnet`

### `research`
- Analysis of failure probability in random partitions of networks constructed from nodes with prescribed voting “weights”:  
- Considered a scenario when weights and Byzantine labels of nodes are sampled once, i.e. fixed, and then assigned to committees randomly.
- A derivation of a probability distribution for the random process is currently in progress
- Considered designing a gradient descent algorithm which, given weights and Byzantine labels of nodes, tries to find assignments to committees with the smallest number of failures. 
- Analysis and implementation of the above algorithm is currently in progress. -reviewed literature on analysis of Loopix mixnets and implemented code for a simulation which computes fraction of de-anonymized messages.  
- The details on all of the above are provided in [https://www.overleaf.com/read/kkmsngmcgbkj#c4de95](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kkmsngmcgbkj#c4de95 "https://www.overleaf.com/read/kkmsngmcgbkj#c4de95")

### `development`

- Walked through core parts of Nym implementation again to get details of what are written in papers.
- Clarified sphinx packet creation process (+ encryption): https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2#d0bbc9d1f63e43faaa30bb4c888102bd]
- Clarified delay calculation in Poisson distribution (inspired to Nym impl): [https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#3ae7e03fcbad461ab8d6b57e5c0e88fe](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#3ae7e03fcbad461ab8d6b57e5c0e88fe "https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#3ae7e03fcbad461ab8d6b57e5c0e88fe")
- Clarified loop cover traffic creation & interval in Poisson (inspired to Nym impl): [https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#14f53c5d6c844c828689f0412d5e2195](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#14f53c5d6c844c828689f0412d5e2195 "https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#14f53c5d6c844c828689f0412d5e2195")
- Suggesting skipping two other types of cover traffic (at least, for now)
	- Drop cover by nomos-node: https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#76993c1312ea464a88557987a2f37b60
		- Loop cover by mix-node: https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#f07a473a4b5d4f338ff024a145f6b525
- Nomos integration test stabilization: [https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/533](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/533 "https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/533")
- Mixnet implementation improvement
    - Fixed the concurrent packet handling in Mixnode: [https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/530](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/530 "https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/530")
 
## `testnet`

### `development`

- Public deployment of Nomos testnet on nomos.tech infra: ⁠[general](https://discord.com/channels/1111286067413405788/1111288368723148941/1172569448381694004), [https://github.com/status-im/infra-misc/issues/189](https://github.com/status-im/infra-misc/issues/189 "https://github.com/status-im/infra-misc/issues/189"), [https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/513](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/513 "https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/513"), [https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/520](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/520 "https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/520"), [https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/524](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/524 "https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/524")
- The hardware and automation done and already running a master branch of our docker compose testnet. New tasks will be created for improving metrics, logging and stability, but this is a big milestone as we are now in control of this environment.
- Prometheus with new http api: [https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/522](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/522 "https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/522"), [https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/issues/523](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/issues/523 "https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/issues/523")
- A proposal for metrics collection using prometheus, this will enable us to see what's happening in the node network easier.
- Simulations finalization times debugging: The issue when views are advanced faster than they should in simulations remains, the ability to remove all network constraints didn't resolve the issue. I still don't know the main reason for it, hopefully this week we'll have a breakthrough in this regard.
- Fixed an issue with nomos-cli api [https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/525](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/525 "https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/525")

## `private PoS`

### `research`

- "Delegation and Validation Rewards" doc update: https://www.notion.so/Delegation-and-Validation-Rewards-d4af3f87a0b240739ff99b15af11cb3f?pvs=4
- Multi-staking: The discussion doc was discussed and we have decided that the complexities mentioned in the document are currently out of the scope.
- Private Leader Election: During the week it become more apparent that the private voting design is not a priority and we have decided to design a (general also multi-staking compatible) private leader election mechanism that is based on the single-staking design. The output is documented here: [https://www.notion.so/Private-Leader-Election-for-Carnot-PoS-e720168ff3c44d098ec6a4aa586188da?pvs=4](https://www.notion.so/Private-Leader-Election-for-Carnot-PoS-e720168ff3c44d098ec6a4aa586188da?pvs=4 "https://www.notion.so/Private-Leader-Election-for-Carnot-PoS-e720168ff3c44d098ec6a4aa586188da?pvs=4")
