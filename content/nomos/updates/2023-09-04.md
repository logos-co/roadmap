### `network privacy and mixnet:`

#### `research`

- No specific research tasks reported this week related to this milestone.

#### `development`

- Made mixnet tests stable: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/334
- Finished the delay implementation: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/362
- Migrated the mixnode binary to Overwatch for better integration: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/339
- Added a retry mechanism to the libp2p backend for transient errors: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/332
- Fixed network tests failing with mixnet: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/338
- Fix panic for RandomDelayIter: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/335
- Connection cache for mixnet: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/343
- Implemented mempool network adapters for libp2p: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/344
- Implemented the libp2p version of the addtx endpoint: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/345

### `testnet:`

#### `development:`

- POC/Draft for testnet using Docker Compose: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/364
- DNS Multiaddr parsing and peer id configuration: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/346, https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/361

### `private PoS:`

#### `research:`

- Introduced the Base Design section, focusing on the ZCash design's constructions, building an understanding of the data structures and algorithms, and presenting relevant algorithms with comprehensive descriptions.
- Developed the Staking Extension section, leveraging Base Design constructions to introduce staking mechanics, defining the "Stake" algorithm that transforms shielded coins into voting "staking coins", and the "Reward" algorithm that distributes rewards and restakes coins back into the pool.
- Created the Consensus Modifications section, detailing modifications to the Carnot Consensus algorithm based on the Staking Extension, introducing mapping of staking coins to validator "shadows", presenting the initial voting construction, introducing a vote aggregation mechanism, and elaborating on vote dissemination and aggregation through a tree overlay.

### `data availability:`

#### `research:`

- Studied more options for DA verification schemes: https://www.notion.so/Data-Availability-Specification-WIP-c3961b681eba4ccdab2be9181e4207b4
- Reached some conclusions that allow us to make progress in implementing the architecture. Blocker: we need specialized cryptographic expertise to make further progress on this. I will personally keep working on it later on, but privacy matters are more important now as they have a higher impact on the architecture.
- Analysis of node decay in the data availability problem is complete: https://www.overleaf.com/read/gzqvbbmfnxyp

#### `development:`

- Included BL blobs in the block: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/368
