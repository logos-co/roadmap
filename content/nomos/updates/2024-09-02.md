## `P2P Privacy`

### `Research`

- Currently in the process of researching a couple of potential designs for pay-per-mix, starting from a form of non-interactive and off-chain rate limiting, then trying to construct a form of payment on top of that. These are considered without compromising the privacy properties of the Nomos Mix. The first version can be seen in this [document](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Mix-Peer-to-Peer-Mix-Network-over-Gossip-Channel-11e9c70a656d4ff1858bc46a715f4c59?pvs=4#dee3a11560834b689f41447c678ad2e6) (WIP).
- Considered the latency of a broadcast in the high connectivity regime of communication networks. In this regime, a node is connected to a fraction of all nodes in the network. Assumed that a message delay is governed by a Geometric distribution with parameter q, i.e., a message is removed from the out-queue with probability q, and a constant delay in communication links. For this model of delays, the latency of broadcast, computed numerically, converges to 2 units of time as the number of nodes, N, in the network grows. However, the distribution of delays can be very broad for a small q (and small N), suggesting that in a high connectivity regime to have q≥12q \geq \frac{1}{2}q≥21​ is more desirable. This work is summarized in this [document](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-Nomos-Mixnet-Anonymous-Communication-AC-System-c97d73a7b8894cf7830e8345f0cc37a4?pvs=4#f3ec94ae55884fa386a50c425bef695b).

- [PR #706](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/706) (Node) - fixes and updates to traits, service implementation, and libp2p network backend implementation.
- [PR #708](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/708) (Node) - (WIP) plugging sampling into consensus.
- [PR #709](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/709) (Node) - implemented the backend (including tests). Currently in review.
- [PR #710](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/710) (Node) - implemented a few fixes to the sampling service backend.
- [PR #711](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/711) (Node) - added integration tests for dispersal using Nomos Cli.
- [PR #712](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/712) (Node) - added the sampling service rng suggestion to the Nomos Node.
- [PR #713](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/713) (Node) - added the Verifier and Indexer to the Nomos Node.

## `PPoS/Consensus`

### `Research`

- [PR #114](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/114) (Nomos-specs) - included the PoL using (using the randomness of the last PoL for the slot) in the code spec.
- Concluded the [development](https://github.com/vacp2p/token-economics/tree/cryptarchia-selfish-behavior/Nomos/selfish_behavior) required to run selfish behavior simulations. Also ran a few simulations to observe the occurrence of classes of validators, occurrence of blocks, and forks. Based on that, included a few more paragraphs in the Selfish Behavior [section](https://www.notion.so/Does-Crypsinous-Leader-Election-Function-lead-to-wealth-concentration-in-PoS-b81f07a791b745438443f51f00ac258f#22fa3481f8ff452db8bce847b74e33b9) and created the PoS [model](https://github.com/vacp2p/token-economics/tree/cryptarchia-selfish-behavior/Nomos/agent_based_pos).

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `Coordination Layer`

### `Research`

- Circle Stark protocol steps and the verification implementation steps for Stwo have been prepared in this (WIP) [document](https://www.notion.so/Preliminary-Research-Stwo-Wrapper-82f900dce90d4532be844c477b8cc618?d=56f1bb50966e4307a7e636be4c0d0d55#58a4aa16938945f994f6bf67d7dfe221) (we generated the first Stwo proof using Poseidon hash function for the oracle).
- Added a [report](https://www.notion.so/Atomic-Transfer-PoC-Report-e183a60586154ba99a67b09ee36d25cd) on the Coordination Layer PoC.
- CL Spec has been [updated](https://www.notion.so/Coordination-Layer-Data-Model-Specification-9a60bd41167d426abb0cd07a01aab905?pvs=4) to reflect the changes from PoC.
- Atomic Transfer [report](https://www.notion.so/Atomic-Transfer-PoC-Report-e183a60586154ba99a67b09ee36d25cd?pvs=4) has been finished.
