## `network privacy and mixnet`

### `research`

- 
### `development`

- Refined Mixnet specs: [Decided](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#8113c6871a8c4bdc8ae469f8fd96c061) to use libp2p even for direct QUIC connections for v1, so that we can use peer discovery and NAT traversal later on; [Defined](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#7cefe07a3ac04af091a5a8945d11067a) an initial approach to report on unresponsive mix nodes, though it should be improved later; [Simplified](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#df9f03a808134ae19c085ca40b82161c) the specification of using Sphinx packets, by abstracting the [internal Sphinx spec](https://www.notion.so/Sphinx-Packet-Specification-1c96e0e8aa8a4241ae9c1417c67714b7) ;[Updated](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#67865a813ab8466987ed54cf92eb86cb) the calculation of `lambda` and `mu` by suggesting a refined approach of emission rates; [Decided](https://www.notion.so/Mixnet-Specification-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2?pvs=4#15ccbb03a44f42658ea67a33527ecea2) to start with only mixnode-defined delays.
- Three quarters of mixnet python specification code has been done; since it has been decided to move [Sphinx out of the mixnet specs](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/46)(see comments) - it will be moved to a new repo in order to be utilized properly; the [basic structure and topology construction](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/44) and [Sphinx packet builder](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/47) have also been added.
- Research of [QUIC and QUIC connections](https://www.notion.so/QUIC-and-QUIC-connections-management-bd7974e3a9914b8d819fd50e6f6a6410) - what is available and what is the difference from the TCP connections
## `testnet`

### `development`

- Initial node metrics [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/522) has been merged - to reiterate, this will add metrics service + initial metrics for CL and DA mempools. We will continue the effort to collect data about other services in the coming weeks.

## `cryptarchia`

### `research`

- The Private Proof of Stake milestone has been renamed to Cryptarchia in order to better reflect current work.
- Updated the [living document](https://www.notion.so/Does-Crypsinous-Leader-Election-Function-lead-to-wealth-concentration-in-PoS-b81f07a791b745438443f51f00ac258f?pvs=4#1df422f6cc204cb8b362f41cda260b8b) that showcases if the leader election function leads to wealth concentration - more precisely the stochastic fork choice rule - which seems to ignore the validator stake.
- [Analysis](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fzbrxvkwwscq#f2907c](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fzbrxvkwwscq#f2907c) of total stake inference problem: For the statistical estimator of the total stake D, the results of a large stake expansion were used to derive Gaussian approximation for the distribution of D. The latter was used to define “confidence” and “accuracy”. The large stake expansion was used to study other important properties, such as convergence rate of inference algorithm, and provides a relatively simple and compact set of relations between different parameters, such as number of nodes N, learning rate h, number of epochs T, stake mean and stake variance
- We were able to answer most of the open questions (from previous weekly - remaining is analytical grounds for fast convergence) - How big should `T` be (# of slots in an epoch), How small should `h` be , How fast does this converge.
- We have a general solution to the [total stake inference problem](https://www.notion.so/Lottery-Function-65f5ed5522b64c36b625652023318d88?pvs=4#7978b9a3f3964c3b9751b2644875506e) - based on this document we have a good understanding of Accuracy, Convergence Rate and Stability.
- Writing of the Cryptarchia specification is well underway - you can check the latest version [here](https://www.notion.so/Cryptarchia-Specifications-a11d16a37c81452a8c89a94ced3ceef5#c69e608758574a85b7278470bd812ef0).
- Reviewed Ouroboros Praos, the focus was to understand the whole design and put a bit more attention at the design of the random beacon and some security assumptions. More on that in the [notes](https://www.notion.so/Ouroboros-Family-8cd7285459f640b088716905ab03474f).

### `development`

- The Cryptarchia [development plan](https://www.notion.so/Crypsinous-planning-f18ea790291141bea19b496c1f59b28c) initially stated is still valid and has been updated. We will have the first milestone defined soon as well.
- Refactor consensus engine in preparation for adding a new consensus - [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/556).

## `data availability`

### `research`

- The [DA Layer Comparison table](https://www.notion.so/DA-Layer-Comparison-Table-5848811f0af042e2b24c10d3cea9b0a8) has been finished and is currently in review and update phase. For the raw data, refer to this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I2hk69hWLVXaATC5048tLcw2qUTjiZORIzL0y90PTLg/edit#gid=0)
- [Block format specification](https://www.notion.so/Block-Format-Specification-10c4cfef8b8946b8a54344cf97b16938) has been added.
- [DA API](https://www.notion.so/DA-Api-specification-83000d9c2f3f45b586cd55c5c195cce5) specification has been added.

### `development`

- Merged a couple of small fixes for the nomos-chat app - more details [here](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/555).

## `miscellaneous`

- 3 interrelated topics that have the potential to create an interesting element of differentiation have been researched: turning Execution Zones into Plasma chains with ZK proofs ([findings](https://www.notion.so/Plasma-ca4bfeb776e240859f954e8511103111)), solutions for instant deposit/withdrawal, solutions for ZK-bridging with the Base Layer (basically the CL layer, but as minimal as possible).
- Polygon Avail has also been researched - [findings](https://www.notion.so/Polygon-Avail-bc5bfbbf78c74b9aba6d4500d961ef03).
- [Simulations working principle](https://www.notion.so/Simulations-working-principle-Carnot-paper-Appendix-c83740646adf4dd58e6b3212f7c1b666) (the Carnot paper Appendix) has been added.
- Whitepaper feedback review in progress.
- Carnot paper has also been reviewed.
