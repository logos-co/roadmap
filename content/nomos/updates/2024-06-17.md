## `P2P Privacy`

### `Research`

- Mixnet v2 Simulation: ran the passive adversary simulation and posted the result [here](https://www.notion.so/P2P-Privacy-Passive-Adversary-ecbcb7ea509b4337b66de515d900dd50#6f769c65b2bd4d208254b2b1c94d485f). We can see that the accuracy of timing attack (by passive adversary) significantly decreases as the number of mix layers and cover traffic increase. Next, we need to analyze this result along with bandwidth usages to find the optimal parameters of cover traffic and mix layers.
- Analysis of the mix gadget: For the analysis of random graphs, generated by random sampling of k-paths in the mix gadget, wrote an interpretation of the result of this [analysis](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-mix-gadget-6246ab47a8e34ac0bc7b561d32680e34?pvs=4#a95c3cb398cd4ae0b12c7becc1b92934). Based on this, looked at a more optimal approach for anonymous communication family of random graphs - [notes](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-mix-gadget-6246ab47a8e34ac0bc7b561d32680e34?pvs=4#c0a271ee4c944268831c25b399efc43e).
- Updated the sparse network section of the Security of Mixing over Broadcasting Channel [document](https://www.notion.so/Security-of-Mixing-over-Broadcasting-Channel-e09184fa14614d78829f76fdb4aa65d3#bf605ed72fcb4b64b27e4184547226b4), as well as the models and finished the global view section. In the document, we have discussed what can be observed without cover traffic in our scenario, the cover traffic design, and how the cover traffic impacts on the observer capabilities to link the traffic. 

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `Data Availability`

### `Research`

- Studied on the Henosis design and wrote [notes](https://www.notion.so/Henosis-9d61c6f3085b484f85df9b48de1b0dc3) on it. It's a study related to combining heterogeneous proofs in proof aggregation - this may be used as an inspiration in Nomos. The [code](https://github.com/availproject/Henosis/tree/main "https://github.com/availproject/Henosis/tree/main) is available on GitHub.
- FK20 running [specification](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/95) in python: added tests to double check that generated proofs are the same.
- FK20 [implementation](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/tree/da-fk20) in python: implemented FFT methods and added FFT parallelization version.

### `Development`

- DA HTTP API and integration to the node is still in progress.

## `PPoS/Consensus`

### `Research`

- Improved the results in the [wealth concentration document](https://www.notion.so/Does-Crypsinous-Leader-Election-Function-lead-to-wealth-concentration-in-PoS-b81f07a791b745438443f51f00ac258f).

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `Coordination Layer`

### `Research`

- We've restarted the CL executable specification in rust ([PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs/pull/93/files)). The following parts have been specified: notes, nullifiers, ptx input, ptx output, partial tx. Still remaining to be specified: tx bundle of ptx's, birth/death constraints, integration with SP1 snarks.

### `Development`

- No updates this week.

## `Testnet + Insights`


### `Development`

- Finished the tracing subscriber and connected it to Graylog in the testnet: - [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/659) merged.
- Implemented minor changes to the CI for the updated rust version: [PR](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/661).
