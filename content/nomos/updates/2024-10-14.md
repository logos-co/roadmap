## `PPoS / Consensus / DA`

### `Research`

- Continued analysis of “safety and liveness” in a variant of the Ouroboros consensus algorithm. We reviewed the first paper, “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol.” In addition to proving persistence and liveness properties, the paper also shows that these properties hold (with high probability) for “covert adversaries” who extend multiple chains without broadcasting. All proofs related to covert adversaries involve constants that need to be estimated. This work is summarized [here](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-safety-and-liveness-1188f96fb65c804c9f46c04c5763de8c?pvs=4#11f8f96fb65c8001bb87d5435bab577d).
- Wrote a [simplified version](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-safety-and-liveness-1188f96fb65c804c9f46c04c5763de8c?pvs=4#1198f96fb65c808aae6df33fe5a5199e) of the idealized consensus algorithm to be used in further analysis. Developed an algorithm to simulate mixing and broadcasting in the consensus algorithm based on generating random networks. This could provide more accurate latency estimates relevant to forking properties. This work is summarized [here](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-the-Nomos-Mixnet-Anonymous-Communication-AC-System-c97d73a7b8894cf7830e8345f0cc37a4?pvs=4#11c8f96fb65c802c955cd5eb7bcb511b).
- Worked through the [adversarial analysis](https://www.notion.so/Analyzing-Cryptarchia-Improvements-1188f96fb65c804aab14c68f191976fb?pvs=4#1188f96fb65c8006b4b0e0aa162ea179) to understand how much power adversaries have in causing re-orgs on the blockchain.
- Decided to merge the NomosDA Dispersal and Sampling page with the [Verification page](https://www.notion.so/Dispersal-Sampling-and-Verification-10d8f96fb65c80ebb220e0fdad24bbb1). This is almost finished, with the BLS explainer section still in progress.
- Added further [thoughts](https://www.notion.so/Transaction-Fee-Mechanism-Design-for-the-Ethereum-Blockchain-da641345369b44158c213f1cbce22529) on EIP-1559.
- Kicked off a [document](https://www.notion.so/Transaction-Fees-on-Nomos-79e2f4347d0a4ce89b631f43eb0f9bee?pvs=25) titled "Transaction Fees on Nomos," which will summarize and define the three base layer markets: consensus, DA, and mixnet.

## `Mixnet`

### `Research`

- Clarified the details of the Persistent Transmission Rate, specifically how often data messages (real and cover) are emitted and how frequently drop messages are generated. The [spec document](https://www.notion.so/WIP-Nomos-Network-Tier-1-Persistent-Transmission-Module-10b8f96fb65c807cb1e8f92a7f41a771#10c8f96fb65c8087bc5bc89970c6397e) has been updated accordingly. However, some clarifications are still needed to implement the spec correctly, with ongoing discussions aiming to complete this by the end of the week.
- Worked on finding the “sweet spot” between message dissemination latency, bandwidth, and network size. This required some design changes, summarized in [this document](https://www.notion.so/Nomos-Network-Limits-Discussion-1198f96fb65c8052add0f7a60f7ce53f). The conclusion is that we can propagate messages through the network using less than 1800 kbps for up to 6 seconds per hop (worst case scenario), assuming 225 ms instead of 300 ms for the average connection latency in a network of 10,000 nodes. This represents a solid result.
- Began implementing these changes in the design documentation, leading to a major rewrite of the [Tier 1 part](https://www.notion.so/WIP-Nomos-Network-Tier-1-Persistent-Transmission-Module-10b8f96fb65c807cb1e8f92a7f41a771#11c8f96fb65c80ceb3c3ddaae55d1224). This rewrite not only addresses the design changes but also removes the “relayer” (an abstract message handler), opting instead for direct interaction with the upper tier of the design.

### `Development`

- Currently integrating the `nomos-mix` crate (which contains protocol details but needs updates) into the Nomos node codebase. Testing is still in progress. A PR is expected early this week. This integration is not blocked by ongoing discussions in the `Research` section, and the protocol details in the `nomos-mix` crate will be updated once discussions conclude.

## `Coordination Layer`

### `Research`

- Continued preliminary research on global state representation, distinguishing between our needs for [state representation and compression architecture](https://www.notion.so/Preliminary-Research-global-state-representation-1128f96fb65c80f998fef97742f8e1e4?pvs=4#1188f96fb65c80b59527c99206428cc8).
- Continued preliminary research on global state representation, analyzing the [exact theoretical complexities](https://www.notion.so/Preliminary-Research-global-state-representation-1128f96fb65c80f998fef97742f8e1e4?pvs=4#11a8f96fb65c80cc99d7e924d3e28e82) of each approach.
- Wrote the [first conclusion](https://www.notion.so/Preliminary-Research-global-state-representation-1128f96fb65c80f998fef97742f8e1e4?pvs=4#11c8f96fb65c80f9b312eef02c7198ca) of preliminary research on global state representation, suggesting we choose between validators holding the entire list and using an accumulator supporting non-membership proof with witness compression.
- Reviewed [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1259.pdf) while evaluating different tree structures to avoid requiring validators to store all nullifiers. Notes are shared [here](https://www.notion.so/Efficient-Non-Membership-Tree-from-Multicollision-Resistance-11a8f96fb65c80818375eaf1f1dad8e2). Unfortunately, this structure does not meet the desired feature.
- Reviewed an issue related to FK20, which turned out not to be an issue. The necessary explanation is provided [here](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/issues/809#issuecomment-2397536374).
