**Nomos 31st July**

[Network implementation and Mixnet]:

Research
- Initial analysis on the mixnet Proof of Concept (PoC) was performed, assessing components like Sphinx for packets and delay-forwarder.
- Considered the use of a new NetworkInterface in the simulation to mimic the mixnet, but currently, no significant benefits from doing so have been identified.
Development
- Fixes were made on the Overlay interface.
- Near completion of the libp2p integration with all tests passing so far, a PR is expected to be opened soon.
- Link to libp2p PRs: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/278, https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/279, https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/280, https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/281
- Started working on the foundation of the libp2p-mixnet transport.

[Private PoS]:

Research
- Discussions were held on the Privacy PoS (PPoS) proposal, aligning a general direction of team members.
- Reviews on the PPoS proposal were done.
- A proposal to merge the PPoS proposal with the efficient one was made, in order to have both privacy and efficiency.
- Discussions on merging Efficient PoS (EPoS) with PPoS are in progress.

[Carnot]:

Research
- Analyzing Bribery attack scenarios, which seem to make Carnot more vulnerable than expected.


**Development**

- Improved simulation application to meet test scale requirements (https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/274).
- Created a strategy to solve the large message sending issue in the simulation application.

[Data Availability Sampling (or VID)]:

Research
- Conducted an analysis of stored data "degradation" problem for data availability, modeling fractions of nodes which leave the system at regular time intervals
- Continued literature reading on Verifiable Information Dispersal (VID) for DA problem, as well as encoding/commitment schemes.
