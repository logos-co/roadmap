## Vac Narratives

### 1 Conduit of Expertise [internally]

First, the strategic objective of scaling project capacity and legitimacy via community co-creation is captured in the annual goal of increasing user-generated content,
code and participation by 50% over the course of 2025.
The preceding step is to set up all projects to accept open-source contributions via an RFC culture.
Second, we have the distinct advantage that we are an actor in our own ecosystem, resulting in the unfair advantage of being our own first community.
Collaboration within our family of projects not only yield efficiencies, but also doubles as a competitive advantage.

VAC contributes to both these goals as an internal conduit of expertise, as well as an RFC culture carrier. 

Viable strategies for a conduit of expertise and culture carrier seem to include: VAC to maintain a repository on internal knowledge creation (via ie the IFT research calls),
RFC culture (to lay the foundation for external contributions), and to identify and facilitate IFT project synergies (collaboration between project must be seen as a way to become more efficient). 

### 2 Premier Research destination [externally]

IFT builds public goods to safeguard civil liberties in the digital age. Ownerless public goods are maintained by movements,
therefore community building is a strategic priority, where VAC plays a technical role.
If only IFT maintains IFT incubated projects a year from now, that would be a failure; if a diverse community maintains projects, that would be a success. 

Ultimately, VAC has the potential to become the equivalent to Ethereum Research.
First, via VAC, IFT already has substantial ties to the Libp2p, Ethereum, and Nim ecosystems. Second, the IFT ecosystem of projects is the first community of contributors.

Viable strategies for a community platform seem to include: To link VAC contributions within other communities back to VAC,
to externalise IFT research call digests, to build trust in projects by open sourcing internal audits/QA/roadmap discussions. 

What to watch out for: A process without a use (ie improvement processes); build value first, community second, and processes last.


## Task Tag Structure

The following descibes a fully qualified task tag

`vac:<unit>:<for_project>:<cname_reporting period>:<tname>`
- `vac` indicates it is a vac commitment
- `unit` indicates the vac unit `p2p`, `dst`, `tke`, `acz`, `sc`, `zkvm`, `dr`, `rfc`
- `for_project` indicates which Logos project the commitment is mainly for `nomos`, `waku`, `codex`, `nimbus`, `status`; or `ift` (meaning it is not project specific)
- `cname` the name of the commitment the task is part of; extending the the name with a reporting period (e.g. `_2024q4`) indicates follow ups to previous commitments
- `tname` the name of the task
