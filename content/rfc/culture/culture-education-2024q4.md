`ift:rfc:vac:culture-education-2024q4`

## Description

This commitment revolves around creating a plan and the start of implementation of RFC culture within the broader IFT ecosystem. 

The effort will align with other projects' releases of critical milestones in order to help out with the documentation efforts. It will not prematurely publish information that projects do not wish to disclose beforehand. The initial effort will revolve around creating a task list to drive the communication with the other projects and create a go-to place (on Notion) which will contain sufficient information regarding the culture.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

* The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository for RFCs regarding all the IFT projects, Nomos included. 
* By educating and implementing the RFC Culture, we want to have projects apply their RFCs to the team of rfc-editors, in the future.
