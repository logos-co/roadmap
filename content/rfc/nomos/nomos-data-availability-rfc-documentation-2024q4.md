`ift:rfc:nomos:data-availability-rfc-documentation-2024q4`

## Description

This commitment revolves around creating the set of RFCs based on the documentation and codebase provided by the Nomos team. The team plans jumpstart the RFC culture within the Nomos ecosystem, assisting the engineers and the users with the extensive documentation with regards to the codebase.

This commitment will revolve around Data Availability layer that is currently undergoing its implementation.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

* The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository for RFCs regarding all the IFT projects, Nomos included. 
* By educating and implementing the RFC Culture, we want to have projects apply their RFCs to the team of rfc-editors, in the future.
* One of our ideals is to have the broader web3 community utilize our RFCs to potentially implement within their projects and ecosystems (similar to how [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) works).
