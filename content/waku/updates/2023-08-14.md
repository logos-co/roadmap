**[Waku Network Can Support 10K Users](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/12)** {E:2023-10k-users}

All software has been delivered. Pending items are:
- Running stress testing on PostgreSQL to confirm performance gain https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/issues/1894
- Setting up a staging fleet for Status to try static sharding
- Running simulations for Store protocol: [Will confirm with Vac/DST on dates/commitment](https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/191#issuecomment-1672542165) and probably move this to [1mil epic](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/31)

## Eco Dev

**[Aug 2023](https://github.com/waku-org/internal-waku-outreach/issues/103)** {E:2023-eco-growth}

- _next_: complete waku metrics, coordinate events with Lou, ethsafari planning, muchangmai planning

## Docs

**[Advanced docs for js-waku](https://github.com/waku-org/docs.waku.org/issues/104)**

- _next_: document notes/recommendations for NodeJS, begin docs on `js-waku` encryption

---
## nwaku

**[Release Process Improvements](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/issues/1889)** {E:2023-qa}

- _achieved_: minor CI fixes and improvements
- _next_: document how to run PR built images in waku-simulator, adding Linux arm64 binaries and images

**[PostgreSQL](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/issues/1888)** {E:2023-10k-users}

- _achieved_: Learned that the insertion rate is constrained by the `relay` protocol. i.e. the maximum insert rate is limited by `relay` so I couldn't push the "insert" operation to a limit from a _Postgres_ point of view. For example, if 25 clients publish messages concurrently, and each client publishes 300 msgs, all the messages are correctly stored. If repeating the same operation but with 50 clients, then many messages are lost because the _relay_ protocol doesn't process all of them.
- _next_: Carry on with stress testing. Analyze the performance differences between _Postgres_ and _SQLite_ regarding the _read_ operations.

**[Autosharding v1](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/issues/1846)** {E:2023-1mil-users}

- _achieved_: many feedback/update cycles for FILTER, LIGHTPUSH, STORE & RFC

**[HTTP REST API: Store, Filter, Lightpush, Admin and Private APIs](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/issues/1076)** {E:2023-many-platforms}

- _achieved_: Legacy Filter - v1 - interface Rest Api support added.
- _next_: Extend Rest Api interface for new v2 filter. Get v2 filter service supported from node. Add more tests.
