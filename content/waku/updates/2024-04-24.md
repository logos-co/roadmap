## Research Milestones

[Store Incentivisation](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/milestone/23)
- Status: In Progress
- Project: https://github.com/orgs/waku-org/projects/17
  - achieved: discuss incentivization with Akhil
  - next: plan out incentivization PoC (Lightpush instead of Store?) 
  - blockers: (no longer a blocker) the deadline for the academic paper final version

[RLN in resource-restricted clients](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/159)
- Status: In Progress
- Project: https://github.com/orgs/waku-org/projects/18/views/1
  - achieved: New Merkle tree integration (LazyIMT) integrated https://github.com/alrevuelta/go-waku-light/pull/2 and new version of contract using said tree https://github.com/vacp2p/rln-contract/pull/31 (with Ar. help). PoC ready to get Merkle proofs from the contract using the finally merged https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit/pull/162. With this tree, we can assume the increase in gas cost and in exchange we get roots and merkle proofs onchain.
  - next: Continue work in go-waku-light and prepare an end to end PoC to showcase this new feature. Write a report with findings and tradeoffs for future reference.
  - blocker: "VacRlnContract" is not compatible with "WakuRlnContract". This https://github.com/vacp2p/rln-contract/pull/31 should be adapted to work with waku nodes (required for the PoC). Awaiting Vac's support.

[RLNv2](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/163)
- Status: In Progress
- Project: https://github.com/orgs/waku-org/projects/21/views/1
  - achieved: merged PR to remove go-waku from waku-simulator
  - next: update to RLNv2
  - blockers: deployment still not working on wakusim host, but there is an issue for infra to debug and I can continue by using the wakudev host
