Milestones for current works are created and used. Next steps are:
1) Refine scope of [research work](https://github.com/waku-org/research/issues/3) for rest of the year and create matching milestones for research and waku clients
2) Review work not coming from research and setting dates
Note that format matches the Notion page but can be changed easily as it's scripted
