# 2023-10-23 Waku weekly

## [Waku Network Can Support 10K Users](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/12)


- _achieved_:
	- Vac/DST team has done further runs with up to 600 nodes in the network as part of wrapping up a [blog post report](https://github.com/vacp2p/vac.dev/pull/123).
	- Staging fleet for Status with static sharding and PostgreSQL deployed and being tested by go-waku team using local changes in Status Desktop.
- _next_:
	- Dogfooding of Status Desktop with Status staging fleet. Will aim to create a small internal Waku community.
	- Continue integration of static sharding in status-go.
- _risks_:
	- Dependency on Vac/DST to conclude ~1k nodes simulations.
	- PostgreSQL implementation has not yet been proven more performant than SQLite. Further improvements and testing in progress.
	- Implementation of static sharding in Status Communities and design decisions mostly driven by go-waku developer, with minimal input from Status dev ([1](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/4161), [2](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/4094), [3](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/4093)). See [status-go#4057](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/4057) for remaining work. Mitigation by on-boarding Chat SDK lead on 6 Nov to drive effort.

### [Targeted dogfooding for Status Communities](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/97)


- _achieved_: hardcoded bootnodes ENRs in addition to DNS Discovery URLs as a way to overcome nameserver issues. Use a static shard instead of the default pubsub topic. Update tool to crawl and discover nodes via discv5.
- _next_:  fix if necessary strange behavior with discv5 when ENRs in DNS discovery URL do not contain shards. Document steps for dogfooding.

## [Waku Network can Support 1 Million Users](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/83) - 2023-11-30


- _achieved_: See 10k milestone update for PostgreSQL status.
- _risks_:
	- Dependency on Vac/DST to run 10k nodes simulations.  Tracked under
		[`vac:dst:eng-10ktool`](https://roadmap.logos.co/tags/vac-updates).
	- Wakutorsis tool is being dropped, meaning new tooling needs to be developed for 10k nodes simulations. It is currently uncertain whether such tool can be developed.
	- Large scale simulations done by Vac/DST only covered nwaku relay. go-waku, status-go simulations are not planned short term (theoretical review of Status Communities messages is), nor are simulations including request-response protocols such as store and filter.

## [Waku Network Gen 0](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/50) - 2023-12-01


- _achieved_:
	- Critical path work for autosharding done in nwaku, in progress on go-waku
	- Parameters for the Waku Network Gen 0 have been captured in an [RFC](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/64/) and use as a basis for [simulations](https://github.com/waku-org/research/issues/23) and [theoretical analysis](https://github.com/waku-org/research/issues/31), removing uncertainty on this milestone around message rates, performance and expected bandwidth usage.
- _risks_:
	- Usage of RLN in js-waku and dependency on a (centralized?) Web3Provider remains unclear as one needs to know the merkle tree state (on chain) to generate proofs.
	- We are progressively moving a nwaku engineer to a solution engineer role we need to backfill the role.
	- js-waku team is juggling between dev ex and gen 0 with only 2 engineers (3rd one joining at end of Oct) so delivery in this client is likely to lag behind other clients.

### [3.2: Basic DoS protection in production](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/70)

**[js-waku] [Task: Manage RLN membership(s) and keys](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku/issues/1600)**

- _achieved_: completed flow up items and main stream of work;

**[js-waku-examples] [feat: re-create rln-js](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku-examples/issues/279)**

- _achieved_: experimented with different frameworks, almost complete rewriting the example;

**[research] [Message propagation times with waku-rln](https://github.com/waku-org/research/issues/42)**

- _achieved_: Ran simulations with 1000 nwaku nodes with rln enabled, with the goal of measuring message propagation delays under different conditions.
- _next_: Some issues with the current simulations, need to investigate shadow tool to simulate CPU "time passing". Some results are not valid.

### [2.1: Production testing of existing protocols](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/49)

**[js-waku] [chore: improve logging when fails to connect to a node](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku/issues/1408)**

**[waku-rust-bindings] [feat: filterv2 support](https://github.com/waku-org/waku-rust-bindings/issues/71)**

- _achieved_: added support to waku_filter_subscribe
