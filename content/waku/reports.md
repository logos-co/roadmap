## Meetings and Weekly Updates

### High level reporting and overview

- Daily standups are posted in the team [discord](https://discord.waku.org).
- Weekly progress reports are submitted as comments on open issues in any public waku-org [github repository](https://github.com/orgs/waku-org/repositories). A script compiles the relevant comments and prepares for publication 
	- Weekly updates pertaining to progress made toward active Epics and Milestones can be found [here](https://roadmap.logos.co/tags/waku-updates).
- [Monday all-team PM meetings](https://minutes.logos.co/tags/waku-all-team-pm/) are held three times to accommodate all time zones.
- Waku client-team PM meetings are held throughout the week depending on the general timezone and schedules of the team.
- Weekly highlights are derived from the weekly dev updates and compiled in Notion for wider publication by the Comms team via the "Waku Wednesday" series on X.
