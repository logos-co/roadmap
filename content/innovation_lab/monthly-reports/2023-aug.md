# Innovation Lab Monthly Report - August 2023

## Waku Objects Prototype

The Innovation Lab team is currently working on the Waku Objects prototype, a modular system for transactional chat objects. Despite some slower progress due to vacations and team events in early August, significant advancements were made throughout the month.

### Key Achievements

1. **Color System Release**: 
   - Released the first version of a color system as an npm package called Luminance.
   - Based on grayscale design and uses luminance for customization.
   - Available for testing in the Playground app.

2. **Group Chat Support**:
   - Completed and merged the implementation for private group chat support.
   - Developed a custom "toy" group chat protocol implementation due to lack of readily available solutions.

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Integrated support for Gnosis chain transactions.
   - Added support for xDai and Gno tokens, with easy expansion for other ERC-20 tokens.

4. **New Domain Launch**:
   - Registered and deployed the latest version to a new domain: wakuplay.im

### Milestones

1. **Completed: Group Chat Support**
   - Successfully implemented and merged group chat functionality.
   - Identified and addressed various issues that arose during the transition from 1-on-1 chats to group chats.

2. **In Progress: Splitter Waku Object**
   - Aims to support group chats and smart contracts.
   - Will be the first Waku Object meaningful in a group chat context.
   - Demonstrates the use of smart contracts and multiparty transactions.
   - Design completed and implementation started.

3. **In Progress: Basic Waku Objects Website**
   - Started work on the website structure.
   - Content development is progressing well.
   - Implementation of the website has begun.

### Challenges and Learnings

1. The team faced challenges in finding existing implementations for group chat protocols, leading to the development of a custom solution.
2. The transition from 1-on-1 chats to group chats revealed various issues with both Waku integration and from a product perspective.
