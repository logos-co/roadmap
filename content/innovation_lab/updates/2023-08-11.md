# **Logos Lab** 11th of August
Currently working on the Waku Objects prototype, which is a modular system for transactional chat objects.

We merged the group chat but it surfaced plenty of issues that were not a problem with 1on1 chats, both with our Waku integration and from product perspective as well. Spent the bigger part of the week with fixing these. We also registered a new domain, wakuplay.im where the latest version is deployed. It uses the Gnosis chain for transactions and currently the xDai and Gno tokens are supported, but it is easy to add other ERC-20 tokens now.

**Next milestone**: Splitter Waku Object supporting group chats and smart contracts

This will be the first Waku Object that is meaningful in a group chat context. Also this will demonstrate how to use smart contracts and multiparty transactions. The design is ready and the implementaton has started.

**Next milestone**: Basic Waku Objects website

Work started toward having a structure for a website and the content is shaping up nicely. The implementation has been started on it as well.
