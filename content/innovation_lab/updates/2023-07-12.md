**Logos Lab** 12th of July
Currently working on the Waku Objects prototype, which is a modular system for transactional chat objects.

**Milestone**: deliver the first transactional Waku Object called Payggy (attached some design screenshots).

It is now possible to make transactions on the blockchain and the objects send notifications over the messaging layer (e.g. Waku) to the other participants. What is left is the proper transaction status management and some polishing.

There is also work being done on supporting external objects, this enables creating the objects with any web technology. This work will guide the separation of the interfaces between the app and the objects and lead us to release it as an SDK.

**Next milestone**: group chat support

The design is already done for the group chat functionality. There is ongoing design work for a new Waku Object that would showcase what can be done in a group chat context.

Deployed version of the main branch:

    the `waku-objects` repo is empty. Where is the code storing that part vs the playground that is using them?

    at the moment most of the code is in the `waku-objects-playground` repo later we may split it to several repos here is the link: [https://github.com/logos-innovation-lab/waku-objects-playground](https://github.com/logos-innovation-lab/waku-objects-playground "https://github.com/logos-innovation-lab/waku-objects-playground")
