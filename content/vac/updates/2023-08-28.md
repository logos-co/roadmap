  - Added a summary table for different performances
- `vac:zkvm::vac:research-existing-proof-systems`
  - Finished Plonky2 research document https://www.notion.so/zkVM-cd358fe429b14fa2ab38ca42835a8451?pvs=4#01301b98f3af4157b932112ed998cff2

### vc::Deep Research

- `vac:dr:valpriv:vac:tor-push-poc`
  - dev: fixed bugs related to initialization, changed to building async tor connections, adding direct peers, triaging/debugging issues https://github.com/vacp2p/nimbus-eth2-experimental/pull/2/commits/431a76014b3f584573329993b167fe1118eca6b3
  - test: readied setup o beacon node(s) with validator keys, test attestation transmission over tor. Planning for measuring delays
- `vac:dr:valpriv:vac:tor-push-relwork`
  - solution section refined with several updates including adding a figure for the Tor-push method.
  - dedicated section on "Theoretical Analysis"
  - four different possible scenarios for the attacker to break the anonymity of the Tor network
- `vac:dr:gsub-scaling:vac:gossipsub-improvements-tech-report`
  - Literature study related to scalability, overlay design, efficient message propagation in unstructured p2p networks
  - Started writing a survey report on efficient broadcast in large scale p2p networks.
- `vac:dr:gsub-scaling:vac:gossipsub-simulation`
  - Executed different gossipsub simulations in shadow simulator
  - can now collect different metrics like packet delivery ratio, data overhead, control overhead, network bandwidth utilization, average latency & standard deviations
-  `vac:dr:consensus:nomos:carnot-bribery-article`
  - Continue work on the article on  bribery attacks, PoS and Carnot. Different examples including one based on game theory were presented to show that bribery attacks are economic attacks and cannot be addressed alone in the consensus layer. Economy based solutions have to be considered at the PoS layer.
- `vac:dr:consensus:nomos:carnot-vote-2-3rds-vote-aggregation`
  - Begin work on Carnot variant that aggregates the majority of votes.
  - Designing the algorithm.
- `vac:dr:consensus:nomos:carnot-paper`
  - Analyzing and discussing Carnot tests. There were variance in the latency results. We think it is due to the geographical distribution of nodes. Hence, Gusto was asked to use a single geographic zone to acheive a smooth curve while verifying that the variance is due to the latency cause by geographical distribution of nodes.

### vc::RFC

- `vac:rfc:rfc:status:port-status-specs`
  - Updated RFC spec for Community History Archive protocol according to PR feedback
    - https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc/pull/610
    - This has been reviewed more and those additional comments need to be addressed as well
- Started porting `/spec/6/PAYLOADS` to Vac
