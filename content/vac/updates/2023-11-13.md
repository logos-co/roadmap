### vac:dst:
- `wakurtosis:vac:retrospective-rlog`
    - Reviewed comments; soon to publish
- `wakurtosis:vac:rlog`
    - Analysis of new Wakurtosis simulations regarding the 600 nodes anomaly
    - Analysis of K8 simulations regarding the 600 nodes anomaly
- `analysis-shadow:vac:shadow-gossipsub-analysis`
    - worked on Topology slices
    - (added more RAM to the server)
- `analysis-shadow:waku:shadow-waku-relay-analysis`
    - Run 600 nodes NWaku Shadow simulations with and without load
- `analysis:nomos:simulation-analysis`
    - The network delay/bandwidth tuning, readjusting the probabilities, none of them helped. The bug(s) cannot be side-steped in any meaningful way.
    - New issue: for > 10 views, the disk usage blows up. *1.7 TERABYTES*; and the output is just text files! This was quite unexpected; we now have yet another scalability issue with the nomos sim.
    - spent couple of days on the Rust code and worked on adjustments. None of them helped with the bug.
- `analysis-gsub-model:vac:refactoring`
    - Tuned/cleanedup to the control messages code
- `eng-10ktool:vac:bandwidth-test`:
    - Machines are no longer blocked
    - Added Kubernetes network policies to void having machines blocked.
    - 600 node simulations with Kubernetes to try to replicate 0 rate anomaly (https://discord.com/channels/864066763682218004/1163414326934257684/1170039531500740718)
    - Started an aproximation of waku-simulator with Kurtosis
    - Meeting with Slava to investigate prometheus dropping container labeling information
- `software-testing:waku:test-automation-js-waku`
    - Helped Danish with implementing the testing part of a Static Sharding [PR](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku/pull/1697/commits/762bc5ad6ecad1d41a4aa6ca9bd6e2832a4779ee)
- `vac:dst:software-testing:waku:test-automation-interop-testing`
    - First [PR](https://github.com/waku-org/waku-interop-tests/pull/1#pullrequestreview-1714207334):
        - start/stop waku docker nodes and connect them in a network
        - send RPC or REST API calls and validate that messages are reaching the peers
        - setup ci runs (on pr, on demand and nightly) via github actions
        - allure [reports](https://waku-org.github.io/waku-interop-tests/4/) via github pages that contain test and docker log attachments for failing tests
        - automated linting and code formatting
        - 2 basic tests for now but will extend after the initial set of reviews
- `software-testing:waku:test-automation-nwaku`
    - Moved most of the PRs, missing one.
    - Implement some store tests.
    - Found (and fixed) issue with default values encoding/decoding for HistoryQuery.
    - bug: `assert false` SEGFAULT.
        - It only triggers on some files, and imports don't seem to be related.
    - bug: Stopped filter node can receive messages
        - It's actually expected behaviour.
        - [Issue](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/issues/2178)
    - bug: Filter doesn't receive messages after subscribing and restarting
        - [Issue](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/issues/2175)
- `software-testing:waku:test-automation-go-waku`
    - Wrote 4 tests related to filter unsubscribe and closed the PR https://github.com/waku-org/go-waku/pull/855
