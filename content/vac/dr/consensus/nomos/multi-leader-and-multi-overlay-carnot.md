### Description

In pursuit of heightened resilience and performance optimization, our research extends to multi-leader and multi-overlay Carnot configurations.
This direction seeks to bolster the protocol's resistance against Denial of Service (DoS) and bribery attacks.
By introducing multiple leadership nodes and overlay structures, we envision a protocol that thrives in adversarial environments while maintaining exceptional performance standards.

As we navigate this deep research trajectory, our collective efforts contribute to the advancement of blockchain technology, ushering in a new era of consensus, privacy, and scalability.
