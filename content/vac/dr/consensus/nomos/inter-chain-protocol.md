### Description

Exploring the interplay between the main chain and execution zones or chains is a pivotal aspect of our research.
Our inquiry delves into how these zones are initiated from the main chain, ensuring their security and data availability.
Additionally, we address the optimization of interaction among independent chains, facilitating efficient cross-chain communication and collaboration.
