### Description

The article describes how multi-dimensional bribery attacks cannot be addressed at the consensus layer alone.
A proper game theoretical, economic analysis also needs to be done. The solution to this problem will also touch on several aspects
including the economy, distributed systems, and cryptography.


This Milestone also comprises a presentation:
This presentation slide describes how multi-dimensional bribery attacks cannot
be addressed at the consensus layer alone. By combining PoS with the
distributed consensus a new dimension is introduced into the ecosystem. Now the
security of the protocol should also be considered against economic attacks.
The presentation provides an example based on the Crypto Economic security
model of how any PoS consensus protocol can fail against a bribing attack. The
presentation emphasizes that a proper game theoretical, and economic analysis
also needs to be done. It also suggests a solution for addressing bribing
attacks in Carnot consensus.

### Risks

This problem has not been properly addressed for PoS protocols.


### Justification


### Deliverables

* A report on how bribery attacks can be addressed in PoS. This will ultimately give a new research direction.
