## `vac`

### Structure

`vac:<unit>:<tag>:<for_project>:<title>_<counter>`
- `vac` indicates it is a vac milestone
- `unit` indicates the vac unit `p2p`, `dst`, `tke`, `acz`, `sc`, `zkvm`, `dr`, `rfc`
- `tag` tags a specific area / project / epic within the respective vac unit, e.g. `nimlibp2p`, or `zerokit`
- `for_project` indicates which Logos project the milestone is mainly for `nomos`, `waku`, `codex`, `nimbus`, `status`; or `vac` (meaning it is internal / helping all projects as a base layer)
- `title` the title of the milestone
- `counter` an optional counter; `01` is implicit; marked with a `02` onward indicates extensions of previous milestones
