`vac:dst:codex:codex-scaling`

## Description
Use real world testing, theoretical analysis and simulation to determine and improve Codex's scaling properties. Find the limits of Codex's capabilities and measure them in different scenarios.

We will allow Codex to scale to support large scale use cases, test how it behaves in large 100TB+ testnet deployments and in various deployment setups, and we will help make Codex more scalable in the first place.

We will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative directly by providing valuable insights to Codex and the ability to theorise, reason about, test, measure and improve the performance, stability and scalability of Codex.

These efforts will contribute in these ways to the Conduit of Expertise narrative:

* Accelerate adoption and development and productising of Codex by providing support to the Codex team in the form of real world testing to improve their efficiency and effectiveness in building a better product.
* Improve the RFC culture by allowing for faster and easier development of RFCs with the aid of rapidly accelerated insights into how an RFC in development will perform as it's being expanded and going through the draft process.
* Allow easier post-mortem analysis of the success or relative performance of a given RFC - does this change use more or less bandwidth? Did it improve things? Seeing the effects of changes at scale allows for a greater ability to usefully wrap up work on and conclude an RFC process and document and absorb what we learned in the process into further improvements.

Further, we will contribute both directly and indirectly to the Premier Research destination narrative by helping Codex build a stable base on which other research and interesting use cases can be built.
