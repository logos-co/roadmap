`vac:dst:ift:deployer-tool`

## Description

We will develop, test, demonstrate and graduate a tool or method for reliably deploying, measuring and scaling arbitrary sets of software that needs testing and validation - such as Waku, Codex, Nomos, etc.

The tool will be used to improve the developer experience of deploying these systems at various scales, including automation, metrics, and the ability to change a running simulation as needed.

It should support arbitrary Helm and Kustomize charts, allowing us to use well defined configurations in the form of Kubernetes resources, managed by modular bundles that can be swapped in and out as needed.

This will allow us to do all of our other work more easily, allowing us to focus on providing value to the IFT ecosystem. Through this, both the narratives of the Conduit of Expertise is supported - through increasing our efficiency, capabilities and the reliability of repeating our experiments and research, allowing us to provide better insights and data to the teams we work with to allow them to make better decisions.
