## Description

The VacLab is a resource provided to Vac by Riff Labs Limited, intended to help us perform detailed simulations and deployments of distributed systems at scale as well as the systems and dependencies that surround them.

With the VacLab reaching maturity where it can start being used comfortably to advance IFT's research, development testing efforts, we want to ensure it is being used to its full potential and that teams understand that the resource exists, and if they find a useful case for their work being improved by collaboration with the DST team through VacLab, they should be comfortable reaching out to us, and confident that we will be willing to try and help them, based on our attitude and more importantly the track record and results we will produce using these tools and our expertise.

The lab will be treated as an IaaS-style service at first, with the raw underlying infrastructure being developed in partnership with Riff Labs who handles the details of making that IaaS layer available to us and reliable. As we progress through the maturity of the lab, we will transition to supporting a more PaaS or even SaaS software model, where as much as possible is accessible to the IFT ecosystem and teams to use and benefit from without them needing to concern themselves with the details of the underlying infrastructure or be blocked by the need to build and manage their own.

It will continue to provide significant efficiency benefits in terms of cost vs output when compared to cloud providers and even on premises deployment of infrastructure, using many independent and cheaper nodes rather than larger more powerful vertically scaled machines, and in doing so continue to reduce and control the costs of testing our systems at scale.

Through the use of the VacLab we will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* providing a unique capability to the IFT ecosystem that would not otherwise be available to them, lower the barrier to entry for teams needing research or services that require infrastructure by lowering the cost and removing the need for them to get it themselves through cloud providers that provide less flexibility and direct control.
* using our knowledge of what is possible to do with these resources, based on who is already using them, and apply that knowledge to intuit new use cases that will unlock better collaboration between teams and the DST, driving and accelerating development of IFT projects such as Waku, Codex, Nomos and more.

We will also provide support for the Premier Research destination narrative by:
* Allowing public access to non-sensitive telemetry and metrics from non-sensitive systems such as Codex storage nodes, and potentially even probes that measure the state of networks such as The Waku Network and Status.
