## Description
Test libp2p on a regular basis and look for regressions, learn scaling properties and run scaling studies, understand the limits of libp2p and its behaviour.

We want to learn as much as we can about libp2p's behaviour and how it is evolving over time with each new release and with each thing we are specifically asked to check and test.

We will use a combination of real world testing, theoretical analysis and simulation to determine and measure the success, side effects and other factors of libp2p and its evolution.

We will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative directly by analysing and evaluating new libp2p releases and their features, both with regards to features they have today and with regards to how that compares to past behaviour.

These efforts will contribute in these ways to the Conduit of Expertise narrative:

* Enable improvements to libp2p by allowing for repeatable, measureable and real world insights into libp2p, all the way from theory to practice and back.
* Reduce the risk of a libp2p regression making it into a new release of our product

Additionally, these efforts will contribute to the Premier Research destination narrative by:
* Improving and strengthening our relationship with the libp2p team and thus increasing the reach and influence of the IFT, and improving the chances that we successfully grow our ecosystem's products and collaborations and especially those we want to work with externally.
