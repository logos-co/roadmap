## Description
Use real world testing, theoretical analysis and simulation to determine and improve Nomos's scaling properties. Find the limits of Nomos's capabilities and measure them in different scenarios.

We want to learn as much as we can about Nomos's behaviour and how that maps to our theory work. We want to learn what new theory work we can do from what we learn in the process.

We will use a combination of real world testing, theoretical analysis and simulation to determine and improve Nomos's scaling properties.

We will measure the real world speeds and latency of Nomos' mixnet, and what use cases it is therefore able to support.

We will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative directly by providing valuable insights to Nomos and the ability to theorise, reason about, test, measure and improve the performance, stability and scalability of Nomos.

These efforts will contribute in these ways to the Conduit of Expertise narrative:

* Help Nomos ship a more scalable mixnet, unlocking capabilities across IFT's teams and ecosystem and allowing for more use cases to be supported and understood. This will also help spur on outside adoption and contributions.
* Improve the RFC culture by allowing for faster and easier development of RFCs with the aid of rapidly accelerated insights into how an RFC in development will perform as it's being expanded and going through the draft process.
* Allow easier post-mortem analysis of the success or relative performance of a given RFC - does this change use more or less bandwidth? Did it improve things? Seeing the effects of changes at scale allows for a greater ability to usefully wrap up work on and conclude an RFC process and document and absorb what we learned in the process into further improvements.
