## Description

de-mls is a decentralized scalable E2EE secure group messaging with Ethereum authentication. 

By utilizing the de-mls-poc commitment, we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Develop the foundational framework for a decentralized, scalable messaging application authenticated through Ethereum, designed to support a large user base within the IFT ecosystem.

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by:
* Develop a standardized decentralized messaging application with Ethereum authentication by providing a well-structured RFC and a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates its practical functionality within the ecosystem. This will allow teams and organizations to build their own messaging applications while benefiting from these features.
