## Description

[Zerokit](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit) is a collection of Zero Knowledge modules that focus on RLN, developed in Rust, intended for integration with various system programming environments.

This commitment marks the next iteration of Zerokit addressed by the issue https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit/issues/263, version 0.6.0, which introduces several new features, including arkzkey, a stateless architecture, and Poseidon hash integration, distinguishing it from the previous version.

By utilizing the zerokit-v0-6 commitment, we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Delivers an optimized version for IFT projects utilizing Zerokit, including [nwaku](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku)and [js-rln](https://github.com/waku-org/js-rln).

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by:
* Offers a Rust crate that serves as a more efficient open-source development tool for users looking to integrate RLN into their projects.
