## CI/CD

[CI builds](https://ci.infra.status.im/job/website/job/roadmap.vac.dev/) `master` and pushes to `gh-pages` branch, which is hosted at <https://roadmap.vac.dev/>.

The hosting is done using [Caddy server with Git plugin for handling GitHub webhooks](https://github.com/status-im/infra-sites/blob/master/ansible/roles/caddy-git).

Information about deployed build can be also found in `/build.json` available on the website.

### Using Obsidian
Quartz is created to serve a static site off of an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, and thus is the preferred way to manage content locally. In order for all it to function properly, a few things need to be done properly.

First and foremost, Quartz uses links references with `content` as the root directory, so when opening in Obsidian, open the `content` folder, and _not_ the repo directory.

Then the following vault settings need to be configured

- under `Options --> Files and Links`
  - enable `Automatically update internal links`
  - `Link format` should be set to `Absolute path in vault`
  - enable `use Wikilinks`

In order to use the templates in the `Templates` folder for auto populating commmon files,

- Install and enable `Templater` in the Community Plugins
  - set the `Templates folder` to `templates`
  - enable `automatic jump to cursor`
  - enable `Trigger Templater on new file creation`
  - enable `Folder templates`
  - assign whichever templates you want to be triggered when a new file is created in a given folder.

Refer the [Templater documentation](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/) for how to create your own templates.
