<p>Overall we continue working in various directions, distributed testing, marketplace, p2p client, research, etc…</p>
<p>Our main milestone is to have a fully functional testnet with the marketplace and durability guarantees deployed by end of year. A lot of grunt work is being done to make that possible. Progress is steady, but there are lots of stabilization and testing &amp; infra related work going on.</p>
<p>We’re also onboarding several new members to the team (4 to be precise), this will ultimately accelerate our progress, but it requires some upfront investment from some of the more experienced team members.</p>

<p>We’ve explored VDI for rollups ourselves in the last week, curious to know your thoughts</p>

<p>It depends on what you mean, from a high level (A)VID is probably the closest thing to DAS in academic research, in fact DAS is probably either a subset or a superset of VID, so it’s definitely worth digging into. But I’m not sure what exactly you’re interested in, in the context of rollups…</p>
</blockquote>

<li>
<p>zk_id <em>—</em> 07/25/2023 3:28 PM</p>
<p>The part of the rollups seems to be the base for choosing proofs that scale linearly with the amount of nodes (which makes it impractical for large numbers of nodes). The protocol is very simple, and would only need to instead provide constant proofs with the Kate commitments (at the cost of large computational resources is my understanding). This was at least the rationale that I get from reading the paper and the conversation with Bunz, one of the founders of the Espresso shared sequencer (which is where I found the first reference to this paper). I guess my main open question is why would you do the sampling if you can do VID in the context of blockchains as well. With the proofs of dispersal on-chain, you wouldn’t need to do that for the agreement of the dispersal. You still would need the sampling for the light clients though, of course.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, great question. What follows is strictly IMO, as I haven’t seen this formally contrasted anywhere, so my reasoning can be wrong in subtle ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>(A)VID - <strong>dispersing</strong> and storing data in a verifiable manner</li>
<li>Sampling - verifying already <strong>dispersed</strong> data</li>
</ul>
<p>tl;dr Sampling allows light nodes to protect against dishonest majority attacks. In other words, a light node cannot be tricked to follow an incorrect chain by a dishonest validator majority that withholds data. More details are here - <a href="https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2019/12/20/data-availability-checks.html" title="https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2019/12/20/data-availability-checks.html" class="external">data-availability-checks.html</a> ------------- First, DAS implies (A)VID, as there is an initial phase where data is distributed to some subset of nodes. Moreover, these nodes, usually the validators, attest that they received the data and that it is correct. If a majority of validators accepts, then the block is considered correct, otherwise it is rejected. This is the verifiable dispersal part. But what if the majority of validators are dishonest? Can you prevent them from tricking the rest of the network from following the chain?</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-dishonest-majorities">Dealing with dishonest majorities<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#dealing-with-dishonest-majorities" class="internal"> §</a></h2>
<p>This is easy if all the data is downloaded by all nodes all the time, but we’re trying to avoid just that. But lets assume, for the sake of the argument, that there are full nodes in the network that download all the data and are able to construct fraud proofs for missing data, can this mitigate the problem? It turns out that it can’t, because proving data (un)availability isn’t a directly attributable fault - in other words, you can observe/detect it but there is no way you can prove it to the rest of the network reliably. More details here <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding" title="https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding" class="external">A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding</a> So, if there isn’t much that can be done by detecting that a block isn’t available, what good is it for? Well nodes can still avoid following the unavailable chain and thus be tricked by a dishonest majority. However, simply attesting that data has been publishing is not enough to prevent a dishonest majority from attacking the network. (edited)</p>

<p>To complement, the relevant quote from <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding" title="https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding" class="external">A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding</a>, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, fraud proofs are not a solution, because not publishing data is not a uniquely attributable fault - in any scheme where a node (“fisherman”) has the ability to “raise the alarm” about some piece of data not being available, if the publisher then publishes the remaining data, all nodes who were not paying attention to that specific piece of data at that exact time cannot determine whether it was the publisher that was maliciously withholding data or whether it was the fisherman that was maliciously making a false alarm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The relevant quote from from <a href="https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2019/12/20/data-availability-checks.html" title="https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2019/12/20/data-availability-checks.html" class="external">data-availability-checks.html</a>, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one gap in the solution of using fraud proofs to protect light clients from incorrect state transitions: What if a consensus supermajority has signed a block header, but will not publish some of the data (in particular, it could be fraudulent transactions that they will publish later to trick someone into accepting printed/stolen money)? Honest full nodes, obviously, will not follow this chain, as they can’t download the data. But light clients will not know that the data is not available since they don’t try to download the data, only the header. So we are in a situation where the honest full nodes know that something fishy is going on, but they have no means of alerting the light clients, as they are missing the piece of data that might be needed to create a fraud proof.</p>

<p>Thanks a ton @dryajov ! We are on the same page. TBH it took me a while to get to this point, as it’s not an intuitive problem at first. The relationship between the VID and the DAS, and what each is for is crucial for us, btw. Your writing here and your references give us the confidence that we understand the problem and are equipped to evaluate the different solutions. Deeply appreciate that you took the time to write this, and is very valuable.</p>

<p>dryajov <em>—</em> 07/26/2023 4:43 PM</p>
<p>Yes, I’d argue it is crucial in a network with distributed validation, where all nodes are either fully light or partially light nodes.</p>

<li>
<p><em>[<em>4:46 PM</em>]</em></p>
<p>Btw, there is probably more we can share/compare notes on in this problem space, we’re looking at similar things, perhaps from a slightly different perspective in Codex’s case, but the work done on DAS with the EF directly is probably very relevant for you as well</p>

<p>Our setting is much simpler, but any progress that you make (specifically in the computational cost of the polynomial commitments or alternative proofs) would be really useful for us</p>

<p>Yes, we’re also working in this direction as this is crucial for us as well. There should be some result coming soon(tm), now that @bkomuves is helping us with this part.</p>

<p>my current view (it’s changing pretty often :) is that there is tension between:</p>
<ul>
<li>commitment cost</li>
<li>proof cost</li>
<li>and verification cost</li>
</ul>
<p>the holy grail which is the best for all of them doesn’t seem to exist. Hence, you have to make tradeoffs, and it depends on your specific use case what you should optimize for, or what balance you aim for. we plan to find some points in this 3 dimensional space which are hopefully close to the optimal surface, and in parallel to that figure out what balance to aim for, and then choose a solution based on that (and also based on what’s possible, there are external restrictions)</p>

<p>I agree. That’s also my understanding (although surely much more superficial).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[<em>4:24 AM</em>]</em></p>
<p>There is also the dimension of computation vs size cost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[<em>4:25 AM</em>]</em></p>
<p>ie the VID scheme (of the paper that kickstarted this conversation) has all the properties we need, but it scales n^2 in message complexity which makes it lose the properties we are looking for after 1k nodes. We need to scale confortably to 10k nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[<em>4:29 AM</em>]</em></p>
<p>So we are at the moment most likely to use KZG commitments with a 2d RS polynomial. Basically just copy Ethereum. Reason is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our rollups/EZ leader will generate this, and those are beefier machines than the Base Layer. The base layer nodes just need to verify and sign the EC fragments and return them to complete the VID protocol (and then run consensus on the aggregated signed proofs).</li>
<li>If we ever decide to change the design for the VID dispersal to be done by Base Layer leaders (in a multileader fashion), it can be distributed (rows/columns can be reconstructed and proven separately). I don’t think we will pursue this, but we will have to if this scheme doesn’t scale with the first option.</li>

<p>Very glad that we can discuss these things with you. Maybe I have some specific questions once I finish reading a huge pile of pending docs that I’m tackling starting today…</p>

<p>Yes, checkout the visual branch and make sure to enable plotting in the config file, it should produce a bunch of figures <img src="https://discord.com/assets/da3651e59d6006dfa5fa07ec3102d1f3.svg" alt="🙂"/></p>
